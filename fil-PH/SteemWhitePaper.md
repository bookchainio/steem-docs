# Ang abstract

Ang Steem ay isang blockchain database na sumosuporta sa pag bubuo ng komunida at pakikipag-ugnayan sa lipunan upang magkaruon ng cryptocurrentce na gantimpala. Ang steem ay pinag iisa ang konsepto ng social media kasama ang aral na natutunan mula sa nabuo ng cryptocurrencies at kanilang kuminidad. Isang mahalagang susi upang magbigay inspirasyon sa pagsali sa kahit saang kumunidad, pera o ekonomiya ng malayang merkado ay isang pantay na pamamaraan ng accounting na palaging maipakita ang ambag ng bawat mamamayan. Ang Steem ang kauna unang cryptocurreny na sumobok sa Tama at malinaw na pagbibigay ng pabuya sa walang katapusang bilang ng mga tao na gumagawa ng * suhetibong kontribusyon * sa komunidad.

# Ang talaan ng nilalaman

<!-- toc -->

# Ang pasimula

Nag sama Sama ang mga user-generated na mga nilalaman upang makalikha ng bilyon dalars na halaga para sa mga magkakasamang kompanya sa social media tulad ng Reddit, facebookat twitter. **Noong 2014, Gumawa ng teorya ang Reddit na maaring mapapabuti ang kanilang plataporma kung lahat ng mga tao na tumulong sa reddit.com sa pamamagitan ng pagpaskil ng mga kuwento, pagdaragdag ng mga komento o pagboto ay mabigyan ng makatarungan na bahagi mula sa Reddit, Inc.[^1]**. Nilalayon ng Steem na suportahan ang social media at mga online na komunidad sa pamamagitan ng pagbabalik ng halaga nito sa mga tao na nakapagbigay ng mahalagang kontribusyon sa pamamagitan ng pagbigay ng gantimpala na mga cryptocurrency, at sa pamamagitan ng prosesong ito makapaglikha ng isang pera na may kakayahan na makaabot ang malawak na merkado, kabilang ang mga tao na hindi pa sumali sa anumang ekonomiya ng cryptocurrency.

May mga ilang mahahalagang prinsipyo na ginamit upang gabayan ang pagdisenyo ng Steem. Ang pinakamahalagang prinsipyo ay lahat ng tao na nag-aambag sa pakikipagsapalaran ay dapat makatanggap ng pro-rata na pagmamay-ari, pagbayad o utang mula sa pakikipagsapalaran. Ang prinsipyong ito ay parehong prinsipyo na ginagamit ng lahat ng mga startup habang sila ay naglaan ng mga shares sa pagtatatag at sa panahon ng susunod na rounds ng pagpondo.

Ang ikalawang prinsipyo ay ang lahat ng mga anyo ng kapital ay pantay-pantay ang halaga. Ito ay nangangahulugan na ang mga yaong mag-ambag ng kanilang mga kakaunting panahon at atensyon papunta sa paggawa at pag curate ng mga nilalaman para sa iba ay kasing halaga lamang tulad ng mga tao na nag-ambag ng kanilang kakaunting pera. Ito ang sweat equality priciple [^2] at isang konsepto ng bago ng mga cryptocurrency na madalas magka problema sa pagbigay sa ilang higit sa anim na mga indibidwal.

Ang pangatlong prinsipyo ay ang komunidad ay gumagawa ng mga produkto upang malingkuran ang mga miyembro nito. Ang prisipyong ito ay ipinakita sa pamamagitan ng mga unyon ng kredito, ko-op ng mga pagkain, at pagbabahagi ng planong kalusugan, na paglingkuran ang mga miyembro ng kanilang komunidad sa halip na ipagbili ang mga produkto o serbisyo sa mga tao sa labas ng komunidad.

Ang Steem na komunidad ay nagbibigay ng mga sumusunod na serbisyo sa kanilang mga miyembro:

1. Ang pinagmumulan ng curated na mga balita at komentaryo.
2. Isang paraan upang makakuha ng mataas na kalidad na sagot sa mga gawang pansarili na tanong.
3. Isang matatag na cryptocurrency na naka-peg sa U.S. dollar.
4. Libre na mga pagbabayad.
5. Mga trabaho na nagbibigay ng mataas na serbisyo sa iba pang mga miyembro.

Ang layunin ng Steem at pagbabago ng mga hangganan ng insentibong pang-ekonomya ay maaaring magbunga ng tama at mas inklusibong resulta para sa lahat ng kabahagi kaysa sa social media at plataporma ng cryptocurrency na nauna nito. Ang papel na ito ay galugarin ang mga umiiral na insentibong pang-ekonomiya at ipapakita kung paano ang mga insentibo ni Steem ay maaring magresulta ng mas mahusay na kinalabasan para sa karamihan ng mga kalahok.

## Pagkilala sa Kontribusyon

Dinisenyo ang Steem mula sa lupa pataas upang tugunan ang mga pangunahing hadlang sa pag-ampon at monetization ng mga ekonomiya batay sa social media. Ang aming thesis ay ang mga parehong paraan na ginagamit upang palaguin ang mga pangunahing plataporma ng social media ay maaring gamitin upang i-bootstrap ang isang matagumpay na cryptocurrency. Kapansin-pansing mapapadali ng mga pang-ekonomiyang instentibo na pinagana ng cryptocurrency ang pag-unlad ng mga bagong social media platform. Sa synergy ng cryptocurrency at social media na naniniwala kami na maaring magbigay sa Steem ng isang malaking kalamangan sa merkado.

Ang hamon na hinaharap ng Steem ay paggawa ng isang algorithm para sa pagmamarka ng mga indibidwal na kontribusyon na para sa karamihan ng mga miyembro ng komunidad ay makatarungan ang subjective na halaga ng bawat kontribusyon. Sa isang perkpektong mundo, ang mga miyembro ng komunidad ay makipagtulungan upang i-rate ang kontribusyon ng bawat isa at makapaggawa ng isang patas na kabayaran. Sa tunay na mundo, ang mga algorithm ay dapat dinesenyo sa paraan na sila ay lumalaban ng mga sadyang maniuplasyon at pansariling kita. Anumang laganap na pang-aabuso sa sistema ng pagmamarka ay maaaring maging sanhi na mawalan ng tiwala ang mga miyembro ng komunidad sa paghihinalaang pagkamatarungan ng sistema ng ekonomiya.

Ang mga umiiral na mga plataporma ay nagpapatakbo ng isang-user, isang boto na alituntunin. Ito ay lumilikha ng isang environment na kung saan maaaring manipulahin ang mga ranggo sa pamamagitan ng sybil na pag-atake at ang mga service provider ay dapat aktibong tukuyin at i-block ang mga nang aabuso. Nagtangka na ang mga tao na manipulahin ang mga scoring algorithm ng Reddit, Facebook, at Twitter na ang tanging gantimpala ay web traffic o pagsensura.

Ang pangunahing yunit ng akawnt sa plataporma ng Steem ay STEEM, isang cryptocurrency na token. Ang Steem ay nag-ooperate batay sa isang-STEEM, isang-boto. Sa ilalim ng modelong ito, ang mga indibidwal na pinaka maraming nai-ambag sa plataporma, na sukat ng balanse ng kanilang akawnt, ay mas malaki ang katumbas kung ilan ang marka ng bawat kontribusyon. Bukod pa rito, ang Steem ay pinapayagan lamang ang mga miyembro na mag boto gamit ang STEEM kapag ito ay nakatuon sa isang vesting. Sa ilalalim ng modelong ito, ang mga miyembro ay mayroong pinansiyal na insentibo upang bumoto sa paraang magpapakinabang sa pagmatagalang halaga ng kanilang STEEM.

Dinesenyo ang Steem sa paligid ng isang relatibong konseptpo: *lahat ng makabuluhang kontribusyon sa komunidad ay dapat kilanlanin ang halaga na nadagdag nito. * Kapag nakilala ang mga tao para sa kanilang makabuluhang kontribusyon, sila ay magpapatuloy mag-ambag at lalaki ang komunidad. Anumang liblib sa pagbigay o pagkuha sa loob ng isang komunidad ay hindi sustainable. Sa huli ang mga tagapagbigay ay mapapagod sa pagsuporta ng mga tagapagkuha at aalis sa komunidad.

Ang hamon ay pag likha ng isang sistema na may kakayahang tukuyin kung ano ang mga kailangang kontribusyon at mga halaga nito sa isang paraan na maaaring masukat sa walang-katapusang bilang ng mga tao.

Isang sistema na napatunayan ang pagsuri at pagbigay ng pabuya sa mga nag-ambag ay ang libreng merkado. Ang libreng merkado ay maaring tingnan bilang isang komunidad na kung saan ang lahat ay nakikipag-trade sa isa't isa at ang mga pabuya ay inilalaan sa kita at lugi. Ang sistema ng merkado ay binibigyan ng pabuya ang mga nagbibigay ng halaga sa iba at pinaparusahan ang mga kumakain ng mas malaking halaga na ginagawa nila. Ang libreng merkado ay sumusuporta ng maraming iba't ibang mga pera at ang pera ay isang simpleng komodity na para sa lahat ay madali palitan.

Dahil napatunayan na ang sistema ng libreng merkado, ito ay kaakit-akit na subukan na gumawa ng isang sistema na free-market na kung saan ang mga mamimili ng nilalaman ay direktang babayad sa mga tagapaggawa ng nilalaman. Subalit, ang direktang pagbayad ay hindi mahusay at hindi talaga viable para sa mga paggawa at curation sa mga nilalaman. Ang halaga ng karamihan ng nilalaman ay sobrang liit kumpara sa mga gasto ng cognitive, pinansyal, at opportunidad na nauugnay sa pagbayad na pinipiling i-tip ng iilang mambabasa. Ang ibig sabihin ng kasaganaan ng mga libreng alternatibo ay ang pagpapatupad ng isang 'paywall' ay magdadala ng mga mambabasa sa ibang lugar. Nagkaroon na ng ilang pagtatangka na ipatupad ang micropayments sa bawat artikulo mula sa mga mambabasa patungo sa may-akda, ngunit wala ang naging laganap.

Ang Steem ay dinesenyo upang paganahin ang mabisa na mga micropayments para sa lahat ng uri ng kontribusyon sa pamamagitan ng pagbago ng equation ng ekonomiya. Hindi na kailangan pumili ang mga mambabasa kung gusto nilang bayaran ang isang tao mula sa kanilang sariling bulas, sa halip maaari nilang iboto pataas o pababa ang nilalaman at ang Steem ay gagamit ng kanilang mga boto upang matukoy ang indibidwal na mga pabuya. Ito ay nangangahulugan na ang tao binigyan ng isang pamilyar at malawak na ginagamit na interaface at hindi na kailangan harapin ang mga gasto ng nagbibigay-malay, pinansiyal, at oportunidad na naguugnay sa tradisyonal micropayment at mga plataporma sa pag-tip.

Ang mga input ng pagboto ng mga miyembro ng komunidad ay kritikal para sa Steem na tama ang paglaan ng mga bayad sa mga kontributor. Samakatuwid, ang mga pagboto ay maaring tingnan bilang isang mahalagan kontribusyon at karapat-dapat na gantimpalaan sa sarili. Ang mga ilang plataporma, tulad ng Slashdot, ay gumagamit ng meta-moderation[^3]bilang isang paraan na pag-rank at pag bigay pabuya sa mga matatapat na mga moderator. Pinili ng Steem na gantimpalaan ang mga nagbibigay ng karamihan sa kontribusyon sa kabuuan nito at ang gantimapalaan ng proporsyonal sa totoong pabuya na binayad sa mga tagapaggawa ng nilalaman ang mga tagapagboto.

# Paraan upang mag Kontribyut

Binabalangkas ng bahaging ito ang mga ideya sa likod ng Steem at ang mga pabuya nito para sa mga tao na nagbigay ng mga makabuluhan at nasusukat na mga kontribusyon sa komunidad ng Steem.

## Kabisera ng Kontribusyon

Mayroong dalawang bagay na pwedeng i-alok ng isang komunidad upang makaakit ng mga kabisera: utang at pagmamay-ari. Doon sa mga bibili ng pagmamay-ari ay kikita kapag lumalaki ang komunidad pero malulugi kapag liliit ang komunidad. Ang mga bibili ng utang ay garantisado ng isang tiyak na halaga ng interes ngunit hindi maaaring lumahok sa anumang kita na natanto sa pamamagitan ng paglaki ng komunidad. Ang dalawang uri ng kapital na kontribusyon ay mahalaga sa pag-unlad ng komunidad at halaga ng pera nito. Bukod pa rito, mayroong dalawang paraan upang hawakan ang pagmamay-ari: likod at vesting. Ang vesting na pagmamay-ari ay gumagawa ng isang pang-matagalan na pangako at hindi pwedeng ibenta ng iilang panahon.

Ang Steem network ay tumatawag ng iba't ibang klase ng mga asset. Steem (STEEM), Steem Power(SP), at Steem Dollars(SBD).

## Steem (STEEM)

Ang steem ang pangunahing yunit ng akawnt sa Steem blockchain. Lahat ng ibang uri ng mga token ay kinukuha ang kanilang halaga mula sa halaga ng STEEM. Ang STEEM ay isang likido na pera, at samakatuwid ay maaaring bilhin o ibenta sa mga kalakalan, pati na rin ang pag lipat sa ibang mga user bilang isang paraan na pagbayad.

## Steem Power (SP)

Ang mga start up na kompanya ay nangangailangan ng pang-matagalang pangako sa puhunana. Aasahan ng mga mamuhunan ng pera sa isang startup na iilang taon pa maghihintay bago pwedeng ibenta ang kanilang bahagi at kumita. Kapag walang pang-matagalang pangako, ang isang startup na naghahanap ng karagdagang kapital sa pamamagitan ng pag benta ng karagdagang bahagi ay makikipagkumpitensya sa mga umiiral na shareholders na gustong lumabas. Ang mga matalinong mamuhunan ay gusto na ang kanilang iniambag na kapital ay ma gamit upang mapalaki ang kompanya, pero hindi maaaring mangyari ang paglago kapag ang bagong kapital ay mabibigay sa mga gustong lumabas.

Malaking halaga ang pagkakaroon ng pang-matagalang pangako dahil nagbibigay-daan ito sa mga komunidad na gumawa ng mga pang-matagalang mga plano. Ang mga pang-matagalang pangako ng mga stakeholder ay nagiging sanhi rin para iboto nila ang pang-matagalang paglago sa halip na panandaliang mga pump.

Sa pagitan ng cryptocurrency, karamihan sa mga mananapalaran ay tumatalon mula sa isang cryptocurrency patungo sa ibang cryptocurrency batay kung asan ang may panandaliang paglago. Gusto ng Steem na gumawa ng isang komunidad na karamihan sa mga nagmamayari ay mga may pang-matagalang pananaw.

Ang mga gumagamit ay maaring ipagkatiwala ang kanilang STEEM sa isang labingtatlong linggo na vesting, at binibigyan ng mga karagdagang benepisyo sa loob ng plataporma. Ang STEEM na napagkatiwala sa labintatlong linggon na vesting ay tinatawag na Steem Power (SP). Ang mga SP na balanse ay di-transferable at di-mahahati maliban sa pamamagitan ng awtomatikong umuulit na mga kahilingan na kombersyon. Nangangahulugan na ang SP ay hindi madaling mapalitan sa mga pagpalitan ng cryptocurrency.

Kapag ang mga gumagamit ay nagboto sa mga nilalaman, ang kanilang impluwensiya sa pamamahagi ng pool ng mga gantimpala ay direktang proporsyonal sa halaga ng SP na mayroon sila. Ang mga gumagamit na may mas maraming SP ay may higit na impluwensya sa distribusyon ng mga gantimpala. Nangangahulugan na ang SP ay isang access token na nagbibigay daan sa mga tagapaghawak nito ng eksklusibong kapangyarihan sa loob ng plataporma ng Steem.

Ang mayhawak ng SP ay binabayaran rin ng iteres sa balanse ng SP na nananatiling vested. 15% ng taunang implasyon ay binabayad sa mga mayhawak ng SP bilang interes. Ang halaga ng interes na natatanggap nila ay direktang proporsyonal sa dami ng SP na hawak nila kaugnay sa kabuuang halaga ng SP na vested sa kabuuan ng lahat ng mga gumagamit.

Ang paglilipat ng STEEM sa SP ay tintawag ang "powering up", habang ang paglilipat mula sa SP sa STEEM ay tinatawag na "powering down." Ang SP na powered down ay binabalik sa gumagamit sa loob ng labingtatlong linggo, via 13 pantay na lingguhang pagbayad, na nagsisimula isang linggo pagktapos ng pag simula ang pag power down.

## Steem Dollars (SBD)

Ang katatagan ay isang mahalagang katangian ng matagumpay ng mga pandaigdigang ekonomiya. Kapag walang katatagan, ang mga indibidwal sa buong mundo ay maaring hindi magkaroon ng mga mababang nagbibigay-malay na mga gasto sa kalakal at ipon. Dahil ang katatagan ay isang mahalagan katangian ng isang matagumpay na ekonomiya, Dinisenyo ang mga Steem Dollar bilang isang paraan na pagtanka na magdala ng katatagan sa mundo ng cryptocurrency at sa mga indibidwal na gumagamit ng Steem network.

Ang mga Steem Dollar ay nilikha ng mga mekanismo na katulad sa mga mapapalitan na mga tala, na kung saan ay madalas na ginagamit bilang pondo ng mga startup. Sa mundo ng startup, ang mga mapapalitan na mga tala ay mga panandalian na mga instrumento ng utang na pwede palitan ang pagmamayari sa bilis na tinutukoy ng hinaharap, kadalasan sa panahon ng pagpopondo. Ang isang token na batay sa blockchain ay maaaring makita bilang pagmamayari sa komunidad samantalang ang isang mapapalitan na tala ay maaring makita bilang isang utang na denominated sa anumang bagay or pera. Ang mga tuntunin ng mga napapalitan na mga tala ay nagbibigay daan sa mga may-ari na palitan sa backing token na may pinakamababa na pagunawa sa makatarungan na presyo sa merkado ng token. Ang paglika ng token-convertible-dollars ay nagbibigay-daan sa mga blockchain na mapaunlad ang kanilang mga eprekto sa network habang pagmamaksimisa ang kita ng mga mayhawak ng token.

Ang mga Steem Dollar ay tinutukoy sa simbolo ng SBD, isang acronym para sa mga Steem Blockchain Dollar. Ang paglikha ng SBD ay nangangailangan ng isang kumbinasyon ng maaasahang feed ng presyo, at mga patakaran upang maiwasan ang pang-aabuso. Ang pagbibigay ng isang maaasahang feed ng presyo ay nangangailangan ng tatlong dahilan: bawasan ang epekto ng maling feed, palakihin ang gasto ng paggawa ng isang maling feed, at pagbawas sa halaga ng panahon.

### Pagbawas ng Mapanlinlang na mga Feed

Ang mga mayhawak ng SP ay pipili ng mga tao, tinatawag na mga saksi, upang mag-publish ng feed ng mga presyo. Ang mga napili na mga witness ay malamang na pinagkakatiwalaan ng mga tao na nag-vest ng interes sa kalidad ng feed. Sa pamamagitan ng pagbayad sa mga taong napili, Ang Steem ay lumilikha ng kumpetisyon sa merkado para makamit ang karapatan upang makabuo ng mga feed. Kapag higit binabayaran ang mga bumubuo ng mga feed higit pa ang mawawala sa kanila kapag mali ang binigay na impormasyon sa feed.

Nagbigay ng isang set ng mga pagkakatiwalaan at pinili na mga tagapagbuo ng feed, ang aktwal na presyo na ginagamit para sa mga kombersyon ay maaaring gamitin bilang panggitna na mga feed. Sa ganitong paraan kung ang minorya ng mga indibidwal ng mga tagapagbuo ng mga feed ay bumuo ng mga outliers sila ay may maliit na epekto sa aktwal na panggitna habang mayroon parin silang kakayahan na maapektohan ang kanilang reputasyon.

Kahit na lahat ng mga tagapagbuo ng feed ay matapat, posible parin para sa karamihan ng mga tagapagbuo ng feed na maapektohan ng mga kaganapan na hindi nila kontrolado. Dinesenyo ang Steem network na kunsintihin ang mga panandaliang katiwalian sa panggitna ng feed ng presyo habang ang komunidad ay aktibong gumagana upang maayos ang isyu. Ang isang halimbawa ng isang isyu na maaaring tumagal upang maayos ay ang panandaliang pagmamanipula sa merkado. Ang pagmamanipula ng merkado ay mahirap at magastos panatilihin ng mahabang panahon. Isa pang halimbawa ay ang kabiguan ng isang sentralisadong pamilihan o ang katiwalian ng mga datos na nai-publish ng pamilihan.

Tinatanggal ng Steem ang mga panandaliang pagbago sa presyo sa pamamagitan ng paggamit ng panggitna na presyo sa loob ng tatlo at kalahitang araw. Ang panggitna na na-publish ay sinusuri bawat oras.

Habang ang katawalian sa feed ng presyo ay tumatagal ng mas mababa pa sa kalahati sa gumagalaw na oras na window ng panggitna ito ay magkakaroon ng maliit na epekto sa presyo ng kombersyon. Sa mga kaganapan na masisira ang feed, ang mga kalahok ng network ay magkakaroon ng oportunidad na iboto na tanggalin ang mga tiwaliong tagapagbuo ng mga feed bago pa makaapekto ang sira na feed sa aktwal na presyo ng kombersyon. Marahil na mas mahalaga pa, ito ay nagbibigay oportunidad sa mga tagapagbuo ng feed na matukoy at ayusin ang mga isyu bago pa maapektuhan ng mga feed nila ang presyo.

Sa tatlo at kalahating araw na bintana, ang mga miyembro ng komunidad ay may higit-kumulang isa at kalahiting aray upang sagutin ang anumang mga isyu na magpakita.

### Pagbawas sa mga Atake sa Panahon

Ang mga kalahok sa merkado ay may access sa impormasyon na mas mabilis kaysa sa tatlo at kalahating araw na maka epekto ang paglipat ng panggitna na presyo ng kombersyon. Ang mga impormasyon na ito ay maaring magamit sa kapakanan ng mga negosyante sa kapalit ng komunidad. Kung mayroong biglaang pagtaas sa halaga ng STEEM maaaring hilingin ng mga mangangalakal na palitan ang kanilang SBD sa lumang halaga, mas mababang presyo, at ibenta ang STEEM na natanggap nila sa bagong mas mataas na presyo sa kaunting panganib.

Pinapantay ng Steem ang playing field sa pamamagitan ng pag hingi sa lahat ng mga hiling ng kombersyon na maantala ng tatlo at kalahating araw. Ang ibig sabihin nito ay hindi ang mga mangangalakal o ang blockchain ay may kalamangan sa impormasyon tungkol sa presyo na sa oras na isinagawa ang conversion.

### Bawasan ang Abuso sa mga Conversion

Kung ang mga tao ay malayang makapag-convert sa parehong direksyon, maaring mapakinabangan ng mga mangangalakal ang mga rate ng conversion sa blockchain sa pamamagitan ng pangangalakal ng malalaking volume na hindi binabago ang presyo. Ang mga mangangalakal na makakakita ng malalaking pag taas ng presyo ay papalitan ang kanilang SBD sa mas malaking presyo (kung hindi panganib) at papalitan muli pagkatapos ng koreksyon. Ang Steem protokol ay pinoprotektahan ang komunidad mula sa ganitong pag-aabuso sa pamamagitan ng paghintulot sa mga tao na mag palit mula SBD patungong STEEM at hindi ang kabaligtaran.

Ang blockchain ang nagpasya kung paano at kailan gagawa ng SBD at kung sino ang dapat makakuha nito. Ito ay nagpapatatag sa paglikha ng SBD at tinatanggal ang mga paraan ng pang-aabuso.

### Sustainable Debt to Ownership Ratios

If a token is viewed as ownership in the whole supply of tokens, then a token-convertible-dollar can be viewed as debt. If the debt to ownership ratio gets too high the entire currency can become unstable. Debt conversions can dramatically increase the token supply, which in turn is sold on the market suppressing the price. Subsequent conversions require the issuance of even more tokens. Left unchecked the system can collapse leaving worthless ownership backing a mountain of debt. The higher the debt to ownership ratio becomes the less willing new investors are to bring capital to the table.

A rapid change in the value of STEEM can dramatically change the debt-to-ownership ratio. The blockchain prevents the debt-to-ownership ratio from getting too high, by reducing the amount of STEEM awarded through SBD conversions if the debt level were to exceed 10%. If the amount of SBD debt ever exceeds 10% of the total STEEM market cap, the blockchain will automatically reduce the amount of STEEM generated through conversions to a maximum of 10% of the market cap. This ensures that the blockchain will never have higher than a 10% debt-to-ownership ratio.

The percentage floors used to compute STEEM creation are based on the supply including the STEEM value of all outstanding SBD and SP (as determined by the current rate / feed).

### Interes

Ang SBD ay bumabayad sa mayhawak ng interes. Ang bilis ng interes ay itinakda ng parehong tao na nag-publish sa feed ng presyo upang maangkop sa pagbabago ng kondisyon ng merkado. Lahat ng utang ay nagdadala ng panganib sa mga tagapagpahiram. Someone who holds SBD without redeeming it is effectively lending the community the value of a dollar. They are trusting that at some point in the future someone will be willing to buy the SBD from them for a dollar or that there will be speculators and investors willing to buy the STEEM they convert it into.

Ang mga mayhawak ng STEEM at SP ay makakuha ng pagkilos kapag ang mga miyembro ng komunidad ay handa humawak ng SBD. Ang pagkilos na ito ay pinapalakas ang kita mula sa paglago habang nag-aambag sa paglago. Ang mga mayhawak ng STEEM ay nagdudusa mula sa pagtaas ng pagbabanto kapag bumababa ang presyo. Cryptocurrency projects have shown that the gains from increasing the user base willing to trust the network with capital ultimately add more value to the network than any dilution that may occur during a downturn.

### Setting Price Feeds

Astute readers will recognize that an interest bearing asset of limited supply may trade higher or lower than the underlying asset depending upon other opportunities to earn interest on the same asset. With a high interest rate paid on an asset pegged to the US dollar many people will bid up the limited supply of Steem Dollars until they are no longer valued at $1. Sa ekonomiks may isang alintuntunin na kilala bilang Impossible Trinity[^4] na nagsasaad na imposible na lahat ng tatlo ay magkaroon sa parehong oras:

1. Isang matatag na exchange rate
2. Free capital movement
3. An independent monetary policy

If Steem feed producers aim to have an independent monetary policy allowing it to create and destroy Steem Dollars while simultaneously having full control over the interest rate then they will encounter problems. The Impossible Trinity says that Steem Dollars either need to restrict capital movement, have an unstable exchange rate with the dollar, or have limited control over the interest rate.

The primary concern of Steem feed producers is to maintain a stable one-to-one conversion between SBD and the U.S. Dollar (USD). Any time SBD is consistently trading above $1.00 USD interest payments must be stopped. In a market where 0% interest on debt still demands a premium, it is safe to say the market is willing to extend more credit than the debt the community is willing to take on. If this happens a SBD will be valued at more than $1.00 and there is little the community can do without charging negative interest rates.

If the debt-to-ownership ratio is low and SBD is trading for less than $1.00, then the interest rate should be increased. This will encourage more people to hold their SBD and support the price.

If SBD trades for less than $1.00 USD and the debt-to-ownership ratio is high, then the feeds should be adjusted upward give more STEEM per SBD. This will increase demand for SBD while also reducing the debt-to-ownership ratio and returning SBD to parity with USD.

Assuming the value of STEEM is growing faster than Steem is creating new SBD, the debt-to-ownership ratio should remain under the target ratio and the interest offered benefits everyone. If the value of the network is flat or falling, then any interest offered will only make the debt-to-ownership ratio worse.

In effect, feed producers are entrusted with the responsibility of setting monetary policy for the purpose of maintaining a stable peg to the USD. Abuse of this power can harm the value of STEEM so SP holders are wise to vote for witnesses that can be counted on to adjust the price feed and interest rates according to the rules outlined above.

If the debt-to-ownership ratio gets dangerously high and market participants choose to avoid conversion requests, then the feed should be adjusted to increase the rate at which STEEM paid for converting SBD.

Changes to the interest rate policy and/or any premiums/discounts on the STEEM/SBD conversion rate should be a slow and measured response to long-term average deviations rather than attempting to respond to short-term market conditions.

It is our belief that these rules will give market participants confidence that they are unlikely lose money by holding SBD purchased at a price of $1.00. We fully expect there to be a narrow trading range between $0.95 and $1.05 for SBD under normal market conditions.

## Subjective Contributions

Subjective Proof of Work presents an alternative approach to distributing a currency that improves upon fully *objective* Proof of Work systems such as mining. The applications of a currency implementing *subjective* proof of work are far wider than any *objective* proof of work system because they can be applied to build a community around any concept that has a sufficiently defined purpose. When individuals join a community they buy into a particular set of beliefs and can vote to reinforce the community values or purpose.

In effect, the criteria by which work is evaluated is completely subjective and its definition lives outside the source code itself. One community may wish to reward artists, another poets, and another comedians. Other communities may choose to reward charitable causes or help advance political agendas.

The value each currency achieves depends upon the demand for influence within a particular community and how large the market believes each community can get. Unlike prior systems, subjective proof of work enables a community to collectively fund the development of whatever it finds valuable and enables the monetization of previously non monetizable time.

### Distributing Currency

There are two ways people can get involved with a crypto-currency community: they can *buy in*, or they can *work in*. In both cases users are adding value to the currency, however, the vast majority of people have more *free time* than they do *spare cash*. Imagine the goal of bootstrapping a currency in a poor community with no actual *cash* but plenty of *time*. If people can earn money by working for one another then they will bootstrap value through mutual exchange facilitated by a fair accounting/currency system.

Distributing a currency to as many people as possible in a manner that is generally perceived as fair is a challenging task. The tasks that can be entirely evaluated by an objective computer algorithm are limited in nature and generally speaking have limited positive external benefits. In the case of Bitcoin-style mining, it can result in the production of specialized hardware and cause people to invest time developing more efficient algorithms. It may even help find prime numbers, but none of these things provide meaningful value to society or the currency holding community at large. More importantly, economies of scale and market forces will end up excluding everyone but experts from participating in this kind of distribution. Ultimately, computation-based mining is just another way of *buying in* because it requires money to pay the electric bill or the development of hardware necessary to do the work.

In order to give everyone an equal opportunity to get involved and earn the currency people must be given an opportunity to work. The challenge is how to judge the relative quality and quantity of work that individuals provide and to do so in a way that efficiently allocates rewards to millions of users. Ito ay nangangailangan ng introduksyon ng isang nasusukat na proseso ng pagboto. In particular it requires that authority to allocate funds must be as distributed and decentralized as possible.

The first step in rewarding millions of users is to commit to distributing a fixed amount of currency regardless of how much work is actually done or how users vote. This changes the question from being *“Should we pay?”* to *“Whom should we pay?”* and signals to the market that money is being distributed and is being auctioned off to whoever “bids” the most *work*. This is similar to Bitcoin committing to award 50 BTC to whoever finds the most difficult hashes. Like Bitcoin, all work must be done prior-to payout and nothing should be paid speculatively on the promise to do work in the future.

The next step is to reward everyone who does anything even remotely positive with *something*. This is accomplished by ranking all work done and distributing proportionally to its value. The more competitive the market becomes, the more difficult (higher quality or quantity) it becomes to earn the same payout.

### Voting on Distribution of Currency

Assume there is a fixed amount of money to distribute, and that those who have a long-term vested interest in the future value and utility of the currency are the ones who must decide how to allocate it. Every vesting user casts their votes on who did the best work and at the end of the day the available money for that day is divided proportional to the votes such that everyone with even one net positive vote gets something.

The naive voting process creates a N-Person Prisoner’s Dilemma[^5] whereby each individual voter has incentive to vote for themselves at the expense of the larger community goal. If every voter defects by voting for themselves then no currency will end up distributed and the currency as a whole will fail to gain network effect. On the other hand, if only one voter defects then that voter would win undeserved profits while having minimal effect on the overall value of the currency.

#### Pag-aabuso sa pagboto

Regardless of how much money any one individual has, there are always many other individuals with similar wealth. Even the wealthiest individual rarely has much more than the next couple wealthiest combined. Furthermore, those who have a large investment in a community also have the most to lose by attempting to game the voting system for themselves. It would be like the CEO of a company deciding to stop paying salaries so he could pocket all of the profits. Everyone would leave to work for other companies and the company would become worthless, leaving the CEO bankrupt rather than wealthy.

Fortunately, any work that is getting a large concentration of votes is also gaining the most scrutiny (publicity). Through the addition of *negative-voting* it is possible for many smaller stakeholders to nullify the voting power of collusive groups or defecting large stakeholders. Furthermore, large-stakeholders have more to lose if the currency falls in value due to abuse than they might gain by voting for themselves. In fact, honest large stakeholders are likely to be more effective by policing abuse and using negative voting than they would be by voting for smaller contributions.

The use of *negative-voting* to keep people from abusing the system leverages the *crab mentality* that many people have when it is perceived that one individual is profiting at the expense of everyone else. While crab mentality normally refers to short-sighted people keeping good people down, it is also what allows good people to keep bad people down. The only “problem” with crab mentality is when people *wrongly believe* someone is profiting at everyone else's expense.

**Ang Kuwento ng Balde na Alimango**[^6]

Mayroong isang lalake na naglalakad sa baybayin at nakakakita ng isa pang lalake na nangingisda sa surf na may balde ng bait sa tabi niya. Habang lumalapit siya, nakita niya na ang balde ng bait ay walang takip at mayroong buhat na mga alimango sa loob.

"Bakit hindi mo takpan ang iyong balde ng bait upang hindi makalabas ang mga alimango?", sabi niya.

"Hindi mo naiintindihan.", sagot ng lalake, "Kapag isa lang ang alimango sa balde tiyak na mabilis ito makakagapang palabas. Gayunman, kapag marami na ang mga alimango sa balde, kung ang isa ay magtatangka na gumapang sa gilid, ihihila ng iba pababa ang gumagapang upang mapareho ang kapalaran niya sa iba."

Pareho lang sa mga tao. Kapag ang isa ay magtatangka na gumawa ng iba, kumuha ng mas mataas na grado, pabutihin ang sarili, tumakas sa kanilang kapiligiran, o mangarap ng malaki, mayroong ibang tao na itatangka na hilain siya pababa upang pareho sila ng kapalaran.

Ang pagtanggal ng "pag-aabuso" ay hindi posible at hindi dapat layunin. Kahit na ang mga nagtatangka "abusuhin" ang sistema ay gumagawa parin ng trabaho. Any compensation they get for their successful attempts at abuse or collusion is at least as valuable for the purpose of distributing the currency as the make-work system employed by traditional Bitcoin mining or the collusive mining done via mining pools. All that is necessary is to ensure that abuse isn’t so rampant that it undermines the incentive to do real work in support of the community and its currency.

The goal of building a community currency is to get more “crabs in the bucket”. Going to extreme measures to eliminate all abuse is like attempting to put a lid on the bucket to prevent a few crabs from escaping and comes at the expense of making it harder to add new crabs to the bucket. It is sufficient to make the walls slippery and give the other crabs sufficient power to prevent others from escaping.

### Rate Limited Voting

A major part of minimizing abuse is the rate-limiting of voting. Individual users can only read and evaluate so many work items per day. Any attempt to vote more frequently than this is a sign of automation and potential abuse. Through rate limiting, stakeholders who vote more frequently have each vote count for less than stakeholders who vote less frequently. Attempts to divide tokens among multiple accounts also divides influence and therefore does not result in a net increase in influence nor bypass the rate-limit imposed on voting.

Users are allotted a fixed amount of voting power. Voting power is multiplied by a user’s vesting tokens to determine how much share in the reward pool should be allocated to a given work item. Every vote that is cast uses a percentage of remaining voting power. Users can vote for more posts, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again. Voting power recharges at a fixed linear rate of 20% per day.

### Payout Distribution

One of the primary goals of Steem’s reward system is to produce the best discussions on the internet. Each and every year 75% of the yearly inflation is distributed to users submitting, voting on, and discussing content. At the size of Bitcoin this could be several million dollars per day being given to the top contributors.

The actual distribution will depend upon the voting patterns of users, but we suspect that the vast majority of the rewards will be distributed to the most popular content.

Zipf’s Law[^7] is one of those empirical rules that characterize a surprising range of real-world phenomena remarkably well. It says that if we order some large collection by size or popularity, the second element in the collection will be about half the measure of the first one, the third one will be about one-third the measure of the first one, and so on. In general, the k th-ranked item will measure about 1/k of the first one.

![](\img_the_new_marketplace.png)

Taking popularity as a rough measure of value, then the value of each individual item is given by Zipf’s Law. That is, if we have a million items, then the most popular 100 will contribute a third of the total value, the next 10,000 another third, and the remaining 989,900 the final third. The value of the collection of n items is proportional to log(n).

The impact of this voting and payout distribution is to offer large bounties for good content while still rewarding smaller players for their long-tail contribution.

The economic effect of this is similar to a lottery where people overestimate their probability of getting votes and thus do more work than the expected value of their reward and thereby maximize the total amount of work performed in service of the community. The fact that everyone “wins something” plays on the same psychology that casinos use to keep people gambling. In other words, small rewards help reinforce the idea that it is possible to earn bigger rewards.

### Payouts

When a post receives a payout it takes the form of 50% SBD and 50% SP. The Steem Power give the user increased voting and transaction power while the SBD gives the user an immediate benefit in a stable currency. As we’ve already discussed at length, SP is designed to encourage long-term holding rather than short-term selling. This encourages more users to have a vested interest in the long-term success of the platform.

Users also have the option to be paid in 100% SP, as well as decline payout on posts. When a user declines payout on a post, the money that would have been paid to them remains in the rewards pool, to be distributed to other users.

# Consensus Algorithm

Consensus is the process by which a community comes to a universally recognized, unambiguous agreement on piece of information. There are many algorithms society has developed for reaching consensus about who owns what. Every government on earth is a primitive consensus algorithm whereby the population agrees to abide by a certain set of rules enshrined in a constitution. Governments establish courts, judges, and juries to interpret the subjective facts and render a final decision. Most of the time people abide by the decision even if it was wrong.

The algorithms used by cryptocurrencies provide a better way to reach consensus. Cryptographically signed testimony from individuals is recorded in a public ledger that establishes the absolute global order of events. A deterministic computer algorithm can then process this ledger to derive a universally accepted conclusion. So long as the members of a community agree on the processing algorithm, the result of the algorithm is authoritative.

The primary consideration is determining what testimony is allowed to enter the public record. Systems should be designed to minimize the potential for censorship. Censorship on the public ledger is similar to preventing someone from voting in an election. In both cases an individual is prevented from impacting the global consensus.

## Consensus in Steem

Conceptually, the consensus algorithm adopted by Steem is similar to the consensus algorithm adopted by companies throughout the world. People with a vested interest in the future value of Steem vote to select individuals responsible for including testimony in the public record. Voting is weighted proportional to each individual's vested interest.

In the world of cryptocurrencies, the public record is commonly referred to as a *blockchain*. A *block* is a group of signed transactions.

With Steem, block production is done in rounds. Each round 21 witnesses are selected to create and sign blocks of transactions. Twenty (20) of these witnesses are selected by approval voting and one is timeshared by every witness that didn’t make it into the top 20 proportional to their total votes. The 21 active witnesses are shuffled every round to prevent any one witness from constantly ignoring blocks produced by the same witness placed before. Any witness who misses a block and hasn't produced in the last 24 hours will be disabled until they update their block signing key.

This process is designed to provide the best reliability while ensuring that everyone has the potential to participate in block production regardless of whether they are popular enough to get voted to the top. People have three options to overcome censorship by the top 20 elected witnesses: patiently wait in line with everyone else not in the top 20, or purchase more SP to improve voting power. Generally speaking, applying censorship is a good way for elected witnesses to lose their job and therefore, it is unlikely to be a real problem on the Steem network.

Because the active witnesses are known in advance, Steem is able to schedule witnesses to produce blocks every 3 seconds. Witnesses synchronize their block production via the NTP protocol. A variation of this algorithm has been in use by the BitShares network for over a year where it has been proven to be reliable.

# Eliminating Transaction Fees

Steem goes to great lengths to reward people for contributing to the network. It would be counterproductive to turn around and charge people every time they attempt to interact with the community.

Blockchain technology currently depends upon transaction fees to prevent spam. These fees suffer all of the known problems with microtransactions and prevent blockchains from being used for low-value transactions. Truly decentralized applications must offer users the appearance of free transactions if they wish to compete with their centralized alternatives. This paper outlines the approach used by Steem to eliminate the need for fees and thereby enable a wide range of previously untenable decentralized applications.

## The Problem With Fees

Blockchains are decentralized networks where all transactions are broadcast to all peers. Every so often a block is produced that includes some or all of the pending transactions. All blockchains must find a solution to prevent malicious users from consuming all of the available network capacity with worthless transactions. These worthless transactions can prevent other valuable transactions from being processed and ultimately destroy the network.

The solution adopted by most blockchains thus far is to charge a minimum transaction fee. A fee worth just a few cents is enough to make attacking the network expensive and unprofitable. While this approach solves the spam problem, it introduces new problems. Imagine solving the email spam problem by introducing a small fee on every email; people wouldn’t use email.

### Micropayments Don’t Work

The fundamental problem with charging transaction fees is that micropayments don’t work, especially for low-value user actions. When a fee is charged on every transaction, it limits the types of transactions that a decentralized network can process. Regardless of how rational the argument for the necessity of fees, users still hate the experience of being nickeled and dimed for everything that they do.

Imagine if the websites we use every day charged us a fee every time we modify our accounts by changing the password. Users expect certain things to be free. Requiring users to make a decision on whether or not an action is worth a small fee creates anxiety that causes users to leave. A transaction can’t be worth so much as to require a decision but worth so little that that decision is automatic. There is a certain amount of anxiety involved in any decision to buy, no matter how small, and it derives not from the interface used or the time required, but from the very act of deciding.

Micropayments, like all payments, require a comparison: *“Is this much of X worth that much of Y?”* There is a minimum mental transaction cost created by this fact that cannot be optimized away, because the only transaction a user will be willing to approve with no thought will be one that costs them nothing, which is no transaction at all.

– Clay Shirky[^8]

In the world of financial payments, small fees are acceptable because the value of the transaction is extremely high relative to the fee charged, and the buyer has already made a decision to buy. The world of potential blockchain applications is far greater than just financial payments and includes many necessary transactions for which fees are simply unacceptable to users.

Systems like BitShares, Nxt, Ripple, Counter Party and Stellar all allow users to place limit orders on the blockchain and all of them charge users a small fee to perform this action. Later if the user wishes to cancel their order, another fee is charged. Systems like Ethereum take micropayments to a whole new level: charging per calculation. All of these systems struggle to attract new mainstream users for the same reasons that a decentralized search engine would struggle to attract users from Google if it charged a small fee for every search. It doesn’t matter how good the service is, people expect certain things to be free. This is true even if a user ends up paying more overall under a different fee structure.

### Fees are a Barrier to Entry

Any fee creates a barrier to entry for new users. Before someone can experiment with Ethereum they must acquire some ETH tokens. Anyone wanting to build a decentralized application on Ethereum must pass on the cost to their customers. Buying a crypto currency is not an easy task and rarely makes sense for amounts less than $10. This means that new users wanting to try out a new decentralized application must first be convinced to part with $10.

### Changing Fees

Over time a network must adjust fees. This can happen either due to an increase in the value of the token or due to a surge in capacity. Users like predictable fees and guaranteed service. While it is possible to dynamically adjust fees during times of heavy use, the result is a poor user experience.

### Sybil Attacks

Centralized websites prevent spam through rate limiting and some form of ID verification. Even something as simple as reCAPTCHA[^9] is sufficient to limit the creation of fake accounts. If someone abuses their account then centralized websites are free to block the account.

In a decentralized system there is no direct way to ban users nor centralized provider able to host a reCAPTCHA and enforce rate limiting of accounts. In fact, the inability to censor users is one of the main selling points of blockchain technology.

### Full Reserve vs Fractional Reserve

Let’s view a blockchain like an Internet Service Provider (ISP) co-op which owns all of the cables in the town and has a maximum amount of bandwidth that it can provide at any time. People living in the town can buy shares in the ISP and in exchange they are entitled to utilize a portion of the available bandwidth.

The ISP has two choices, run a “full reserve” or “fractional reserve” system. Under a full reserve system each user is only allowed a fraction of the maximum bandwidth proportional to her shares. Because not everyone uses the Internet at the same time, the town’s network would be significantly underutilized.

Under a fractional reserve system the individual users could utilize more bandwidth than they are entitled to at any given point in time so long as not everyone uses the Internet at the same time. The problem with operating a fractional reserve is that congestion occurs anytime too many people wish to use the network at the same time. The ISP needs a way to prioritize bandwidth during congested periods. In the most extreme case, a fully congested network must revert to a full reserve system. The challenge is setting the proper fractional reserve ratio.

## Bandwidth Instead of Micropayment Channels

The solution to the problems with micropayments is in implementing *dynamic fractional reserves*. Under this model the blockchain will automatically adjust the reserve ratio for the network during times of congestion. The blockchain will set a target utilization that leaves enough headroom for short term surges in demand. Any time the surges are sustained the blockchain reduces the maximum bandwidth-per-share. When a surge is over and there is surplus capacity the blockchain can slowly increase the bandwidth-per-share.

Bandwidth used by an individual user should be measured over a suitably long period of time to allow that user to time-shift their usage. Users tend to login, do many things at once, then logout. This means that their bandwidth over a short period of time may appear much higher than if viewed over a longer period of time. If the time window is stretched too far then the reserve ratio will not adjust fast enough to respond to short-term surges, if the window is too short then clustering usage will have too big of an impact on normal users.

In our estimate it should be sufficient to measure the average weekly bandwidth usage of users. Every time a user signs a transaction, that transaction is factored into their own individual moving average. Any time a user’s moving average exceeds the current network limit their transaction is delayed until their average falls below the limit.

### Epekto ng Kapasidad

Ang kapasidad ng blockchain ay hindi kinakailangang nalilimitahan. Ito ay lubos na nasasaklaw sa teknolohikal na kakayahan ng imprastruktura ng internet na makapagpataas sa laki ng Bitcoin block sa 10MB na kung saan makakapagdulot ng pagbaba sa pinakamababang kinakailangan na balanse sa paktor ng 10. Habang ang Bitcoin ay kasalukuyang sumusuporta ng mahigit 3 na mga transaksyon bawat segundo, ang mga alternatibong implementasyon ay may kakayahan sa lampas 1000 na mga transaksyon bawat segundo.

### Pagkumpara sa Mga Bayarin

Kung ipagpalagay natin na ang isang gumagamit na mayroong $25 na dolyares na halaga ng BTC na mga transaksyon isang beses sa bawat linggo at magbabayad ng $0.04 na sentimo na bayad sa bawat panahon kung kaya magbabayad sila ng lampas sa $2.00 na mga bayarin sa bawat taon. Ang isang gumagamit ay nangangailangang makakakita ng walong porsiyento na rate of return sa kanilanf $25 na dolyares para lang makapagbreak even kasama na ang bayad sa mga fee. Gayunpaman ang nangyayari ang mga gumagami ay magho-hold sa kanilang pera sa blockchain, kaya ang gumagamit na ito na mayroong $25 na halaga ng BTC ay makaka-ipon ng $2 sa loob ng isang taon sa pamamagitan ng pag-hango sa isang stratehiyang naglilimita ng rate sa kaysa isang stratehiyang naka-base sa bayad. Sa $175 lamang ay makakapag-transact bawat araw at makakapag-ipon ng $14 bawat taon.

### Paglilikha ng Account

Ang sistemang nakabatay sa account ng Steem na mayroong mga balanse na alam na alam ng nakakarami na nagsisimplipika sa implementasyon ng algoritmo ng paglilimita ng rate na nakabatay sa bandwidth. Alinmang account na mayroong balanse na mas mababa sa minimum na kinakailangan upang makapagtransact ng isang beses bawat linggo ay hindi makakapag-transact. Nagpapahiwatig lang ito na ang lahat ng mga bagong account ay kinakailangang mapondohan ng hindi bababa sa minimum na balanse. Nagpapahiwatig rin ito na ang mga gumagamit na nagnanais na makapag-transact sa mas maliit na mga account ay pwedeng makapagtransact, kung sila ay nagkakaroon ng mas malaking balanse at makakapag-gamit muli ng account.

Posible para sa isang account na mayroong maliit na balanse na nilikha sa panahon ng mababa ang paggamit na hindi na makakapasok kapag ang paggamit sa network ay tumaas na. Ang mga pondo ay maaaring marekober sa kahit anumang panahon sa pamamagitan ng temporaryong pag-delegate ng mas malaking balanse papunta sa account.

Upang makapagpanatili ng isang makatwirang karanasan ng gumagamit na mayroong minimum na bilang ng mga hung na account, lahat ng mga bagong account ay nararapat na magsimulang magkaroon ng isang balanse na sampung beses na malaki sa minimum na kinakailangan upang makapag-transact bawat linggo. Sa pamamaraang ito kahit na ang pangangailangan ay tumataas sa isang facfor ng 10 ang account ay mananatiling aktibo.

Alinmang paunang balanse ng account ay kailangang nangagaling mula sa gumagamit na lumikha sa account at hindi galing sa token sa paglilikha dahil sa posibilidad ng mga atakeng sibil.

### Pagbibigay-katwiran sa mga Minimum na Balanse

Ang konsepto na nagpepwersa sa mga gumagamit na magpanatili ng isang minimum na balanse ay natural na nagmumula sa sa halaga ng isang gumagamit[^10]. Sinumang tao na nagpapatakbo ng isang negosyo ay mayroon alam na ang bawat gumagamit ay mayroong mahalagang halaga. Ang mga negosyo ay gumagastos kahit saan mula sa $30 hanggang $200 upang makakuha ng isang gumagamit. Minsan sila ay direktahang bumabayad sa mga gumagamit, sa ibang panahon naman sila ay bumabayad para sa pagpapa-advertise, at sa ibang panahon pa rin ang buong kompanya ay nakabenta na para sa kanilang mga gumagamit. Pagkatapos makakuha ng gumagamit ang isang kompanya kadalasan ay binibigyan nila ito ng *mga libreng serbisyo* para maipanatili sila ng matagal na kung saan sila ay kikita sa pamamagitan nila sa mga maraming paraan.

Ang Ripple ay gumagamit ng [^11] na pinakamababang balanse na tumitimbang sa paggamit sa resource ng account at nangangailangan sa mga bagong account na mapondohan ito ng hindi bababa sa pinakamababang balanse. Sa kasulukuyan ang pinakamababang balanseng ito ay halos $0.15 na mas malaki kaysa $0.10 na ating tinantya na makakapagpahintulot sa sinuman na makapagtransact ng libre kahit isang beses bawat linggo.

A blockchain can enforce a minimum value per user through the simple process of requiring a minimum balance. Any business that wishes to bring a new customer to the blockchain can pre-fund that user’s account with the minimum balance that would allow them to transact. Requiring a relatively large fee ($1.00) to sign up new users will naturally force anyone offering free accounts to vet the quality and uniqueness of each account before registering them with the blockchain.

Maintaining a minimum balance is effectively the same as making users pay transaction fees with the interest they could have earned on their balance. The minimum balance is simply the balance required to earn enough interest to pay a fee in a relatively short period of time.

Fortunately, the minimum balance required can be as low as a dollar and this is something users can understand and appreciate. The opportunity cost of lost interest doesn’t incur the cognitive cost of a micro-fee and is far more acceptable to users.

The STEEM used to pre-fund an account is Powered Up in the new account (i.e., converted to Steem Power). A portion of the SP used to fund a new account may be delegated from the creator of the account. When a user is delegated SP, they may use the SP for voting and bandwidth purposes as if it were their own, but the ownership of the SP remains with the user who delegated it. A user may remove the delegation at any time. After a cool-down period, the SP is returned to their account.

### Effectiveness Relative to Fees

To compare the effectiveness of rate limiting to fees we must consider how the two systems react to intentional network flooding by an attacker. Under Bitcoin an attacker with $10,000 dollars could disrupt service for an entire day by filling every single block. The same attacker would be unable to disrupt service for even a single block under the dynamic fractional reserve rate limiting approach.

If we go to a more extreme case and assume the attacker holds 1% of all coins then we presume an attacker with $60 million dollars. Such an attacker could deny the Bitcoin blockchain service for 16 years unless the miners increased fees or capacity. Even if fees were raised to $15 per transaction, the attacker could still keep the network flooded for 16 days.

Under the rate limiting approach, someone who holds 1% of all coins with an intent to flood the network would achieve their goal for less than 30 seconds.

### Renting vs. Buying vs. Time Sharing

When someone owns a house they expect the right to use the house for free. If a group of people buy a house together then each can expect the right to use the house proportional to their percentage ownership in the house. A fee based blockchain is like renting the house from its owners, whereas rate limiting is like a timeshare among owners.

If a house is owned by multiple people then those individuals must decide how they wish to timeshare the house. Someone who owns 50% of the house but only uses it one weekend per year might expect to be paid by the individuals who take their unused time. This is the mindset of a fee based system.

On the other hand, someone who owns 50% of the house is speculating that demand for the house will increase in the future and they will be able to sell their stake for more. Any owner who owns more of a house than they use becomes a real estate speculator. With this mindset rather than collecting rent, they collect appreciation.

The value of a share is derived from how much time it can potentially grant its owner. Owning 1% of a house and getting it 1 weekend per year is the lowest value of a share. However, if half of the shareholders never use their weekend, then the value per timeshare rises to 2 weekends per year. If those inactive users instead opt to rent their unused time, then it falls back to 1 weekend per year. If those unused timeshares were sold to people who would use them then the value of a timeshare would fall by 50%. Unless the rent collected is greater than the fall in share value the timeshare owners are making an economic miscalculation.

Using this rationale we can assume that a system based on fees will either be more expensive for its users or be less profitable for its collective owners. An individual small owner may profit by renting out his small time slice, but only at the expense of all other timeshare owners. In effect, the cost of the falling timeshare value is shared among all owners whereas the profits are centralized in the single owner who decided to rent his share.

We can conclude from this that a blockchain is best served by not using usage fees at all. If a usage fee were to be charged as an alternative to rate limiting, then it should be the equivalent of buying enough timeshares and committing to hold them long enough to gain the right use it once.

Stated another way, a transaction fee should be equal to the minimum account balance necessary to transact once per week and it should be refunded at the end of the week. Assume the minimum account balance is $1 and allows someone to transact once per week. If someone with a $1 balance that wishes to perform 5 transactions at once they will have to increase their balance to $5 for a week either before or after their transactions.

In theory a market could form where users can borrow the stake required. In practice it is more efficient for users to simply buy and sell the timeshares necessary to meet their desired usage rate. In other words, the cost of negotiating micro-loans is greater than the cost of maintaining a balance suitable for your maximum weekly usage.

Decentralized rate limiting of transactions can enable new types of decentralized applications that were not viable when every use of the application required a micropayment. This new model gives application developers the ability to decide if and when to charge their users for transactions.

# Performance and Scalability

The Steem network is built upon Graphene, the same technology that powers BitShares. Graphene has been publicly demonstrated sustaining over 1000 transactions per second on a distributed test network. Graphene can easily scale to 10,000 or more transactions per second with relatively straightforward improvements to server capacity and communication protocols.

## Reddit Scale

Steem is capable of handling a larger userbase than Reddit. In 2015 Reddit’s 8.7 million users generated an average of 23 comments per second[^12], with an average of 83 comments per year per user. There were 73 million top-level posts, for an average of 2 new posts per second. There were about 7 billion up votes creating an average voting rate of 220 votes per second. All told, if Reddit were operating on a blockchain it would require an average of 250 transactions per second.

To achieve this industry-leading performance, Steem has borrowed lessons learned from the LMAX Exchange[^13], which is able to process 6 million transactions per second. Among these lessons are the following key points:

1. Keep everything in memory.
2. Keep the core business logic in a single thread.
3. Keep cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) out of the core business logic.
4. Divide validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks.
5. Use an object oriented data model.

By following these simple rules, Steem is able to process 10,000 transactions per second without any significant effort devoted to optimization.

Keeping everything in memory is increasingly viable given the recent introduction of Optane™ technology from Intel[^14]. It should be possible for commodity hardware to handle all of the business logic associated with Steem in a single thread with all posts kept in memory for rapid indexing. Even Google keeps their index of the entire internet in RAM. The use of blockchain technology makes it trivial to replicate the database to many machines to prevent loss of data. As Optane™ technology takes over, RAM will become even faster while gaining persistence. In other words, Steem is designed for the architectures of the future and is designed to scale.

# Allocation & Supply

## Initial Allocation & Supply

The Steem network started with a currency supply of 0 and allocated STEEM via proof of work at a rate of approximately 40 STEEM per minute to miners, with an additional 40 STEEM per minute being created to seed the content and curation reward pools (for a total of 80 STEEM per minute). Then the network started rewarding users who converted to SP. At this point, STEEM grew at a rate of approximately 800 STEEM per minute due to the combined effects of the various Contribution Rewards summarized below:

Contribution Rewards:

- Curation rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 3.875% per year, whichever is greater
- Content Creation rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 3.875% per year, whichever is greater
- Block production rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater
- POW inclusion rewards before block 864,000: 1 STEEM per block (awarded as 21 STEEM per round)
- POW inclusion rewards after block 864,000: 0.0476 STEEM per block (awarded as 1 STEEM per round) or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater.
- Liquidity rewards: 1 STEEM per block (awarded as 1200 STEEM per hour) or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater

### Power Rewards:

- Steem Power rewards: For each STEEM created by the above rewards, 9 STEEM are divided among all Steem Power holders.

### SBD operations:

- SBD rewards: A percentage of SBD value is created at an APR set by the witnesses and paid to SBD holders as SBD

The overall supply picture is complicated by the effect of SBD operations, which may result in large-scale creation or destruction of STEEM through feed rate following and SBD rewards, as discussed in the SBD section. Other, smaller-scale complicating effects also exist, including unclaimed incentives (e.g. block rewards for missed blocks), and abandoned accounts.

## Current Allocation & Supply

Starting with the network's 16th hard fork in December 2016, Steem began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 16 went into effect.

75% of the new tokens that are generated go to fund the reward pool, which is split between authors and curators. 15% of the new tokens are awarded to holders of SP. The remaining 10% pays for the witnesses to power the blockchain.

### Impact of Token Creation Rate

It is often said that a coin with an inflationary model is not sustainable, but we know from countless real-world examples that the quantity of money does not have a direct and immediate impact on its value, though it certainly plays a role.

From August 2008 through January 2009 the U.S. money supply[^15] grew from $871B to $1,737B, a rate of over 100% per year and then continued to grow at about 20% per year for the next 6 years. All told the money supply in the U.S. has grown by 4.59x over less than 7 years. During that same time, the value of the dollar relative to goods and services has fallen less than 10% according to the government's price index[^16]. This real-world example demonstrates that supply is only one component of price.

For the first 2 years of Bitcoin’s life the network sustained an annual inflation rate[^17] of over 100%. For the first 5 years it was over 30%, and for the first 8 years it was over 10%. All told the total “spending” Steem does to fund content, curation, and block production amounts to less than 10% APR.

The price of a digital commodity, like STEEM, is driven by both supply and demand. When a long-term holder decides to exit, the supply of STEEM on the market will increase and push the price down. This downward pressure is countered when a new long-term holder decides to buy up the STEEM and convert it back into SP. Additional supply and demand may be be added due to market speculators buying and selling liquid STEEM based on their predictions of the future market price.

# The Power of Steem

Steem recognizes that the value of all user contributions (posts and votes) is greater than the sum of the parts. A single comment is worth next to nothing, but millions of curated posts is worth many millions (or possibly even billions) of dollars. A single vote provides little curation value, but billions of votes is very effective curation. Content without curation is of limited value. Given all the content of the Internet minus the links between it, Google would struggle to produce useful search results. It is the links between information that give it significant value.

Because everyone benefits, everyone should pay. In other words, no individual user should be expected to pay for anything, but instead should be paid for everything they do that brings value to Steem. All we need to do is ascertain which user contributions bring a social network value and which ones don’t.

Collectively Reddit users vote 220 times per second and make 23 posts per second. Reddit is valued between $500 million[^18] and $4 billion[^19] which means that each and every upvote and post is worth between $0.06 and $0.50 assuming the value of Reddit is mostly within the past year’s worth of activity. One could argue that most of the value of Reddit is the near-real-time discussions that have occurred within the past week which would dramatically increase the value of new activity. People go where people are today, not where people were last year.

## No Micropayments, Tips Optional

Existing attempts at integrating a cryptocurrency into a social media platform have focused on enabling users to pay one another. Many services have attempted to introduce tipping. The theory is that if we make tipping simple enough then more people will do it. Other services attempt to get people to pay to promote or boost their content’s ranking. Still others attempt to build small prediction markets on how many tips an article will receive.

All of these approaches boil down to micropayments. They differ only in who is making the payment. They all suffer from insufficient engagement of people making the micropayments. In the search for incentivised content production entrepreneurs have been so focused on who should pay that they missed the obvious reality: everyone benefits from everyone’s actions so everyone should pay or no one should pay, depending on how you look at it.

Steem bypasses micropayments completely because when a user upvotes a post it is the community that pays the bill. The same amount of money will be spent whether the user upvotes a post or not and the funds will not come from the voter.

The mental energy associated with making an economic decision becomes a barrier to participation for most people.

*We already face a multitude of choices everyday with regards to what to access online in this digital era of the information explosion, and every additional decision that we must make simply adds on to the uncertainty and anxiety we face. Micropayment supporters believe that a simplified implementation can minimize the intrusiveness of micropayments and improve user experience, but their argument only creates double standards for the decision making process \[2\]. A transaction cannot simultaneously be worth enough to warrant a decision and worth so little that the decision is automatic. **The only transactions that users can approve without thought are ones that cost them nothing**, thus any micro-transaction of positive value will incur mental costs through its requiring a decision. Furthermore, mental transaction costs actually rise below a certain threshold value, a phenomenon that places micropayments at an even greater disadvantage. For instance, it is easy to think that a copy of today's newspapers costs $1, but readers face much more difficulty and anxiety in deciding on the value of each article or word. Such a dilemma will only be replicated and exacerbated if all online content were to be broken down into their components and individually valued within a micropayment system.*

-Micropayments: A Viable Business Model[^20]

Under Steem, micropayments are paid to content producer, but those who vote for the content do not pay. Instead, the cost of the reward is paid for via new tokens. Someone can join the system, vote to pay someone, and then exit the system with more money than they started with (assuming the market valuation of the Steem system remained constant). In other words, the micropayment solution provided by Steem provides a user-experience similar to many widely used websites that have user-moderated content.

Furthemore, Steem pays people to figure out who should be paid! This kind of thinking is revolutionary.

## Value is in the Links

The Internet would lose the vast majority of its value if all links among content were removed. It is the relationship among web pages that allows Google to identify the best apple pie recipe among the 16 million results. Without the links the only information Google would have is word frequency.

Links can take many forms and have adapted over time. Every time a user votes on content in a social network they add a connection between themselves and the content. This in turn links the consumer to the producer through the content. The more connections a network has the more valuable the information becomes. It is the relative and intentional connectedness of information that gives it value.

A social network can maximize the value extracted from a set of content by maximizing the quantity and quality of connections. Curating content is expensive and time consuming while being near impossible for computers to perform in the absence of links. Steem rewards users who are among the first to find and identify new content.

By incentivising curation the Steem network is able to use automated algorithms to extract the most valuable information from a massive amount of content.

## Solving the Cryptocurrency Onboarding Problem

It isn’t easy to get into cryptocurrency[^21]. Someone who discovers Bitcoin and wants to try it out quickly learns that they will need to sign up with an exchange and fund their account with a credit card or wire transfer. What would Facebook’s adoption rate have been like if you had to fork over money and a two forms of ID?

Steem solves this problem by giving everyone a way to get paid for doing simple, but valuable, tasks. This will help to widely distribute STEEM tokens. This is helpful because cryptocurrencies have a network effect (i.e. more users make it more useful; for an extreme example, consider that if Satoshi had kept 100% of Bitcoin for himself, Bitcoin would be worthless.)

## Solving the Cryptocurrency Liquidation Problem

A currency that is difficult to use or impossible to sell has little value. Someone who comes across $1.00 worth of Bitcoin will discover that it costs more than $1.00 to sell that Bitcoin. They have to create an account with an exchange, perform KYC validation, and pay fees. Small amounts of cryptocurrency are like small change that people are unwilling to bend over to pick up.

Merchants give users a way to quickly convert their cryptocurrency into tangible goods and services. Merchants need a currency pegged to their unit of account, normally dollars. Accepting a volatile currency introduces significant accounting overhead.

Merchants will accept any currency if it increases their sales. Having a large user base with a stable currency such as SBD lowers the barrier to entry for merchants. The presence of merchants improves the system by creating an off-ramp for users to exit the system without going to the trouble of using an exchange.

Another way that people can liquidate the small amounts of cryptocurrency they receive from participating on the Steem platform is through *tipping* others. This is like leaving the small change as a tip for your waiter. When enough people leave small tips it adds up to a meaningful amount. You and the waiter each gain a benefit from the tip.

## Censorship

Steem is a decentralized network that is operated by witnesses in jurisdictions around the world. All user actions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, and can be publicly verified. This means that there is no single entity that can censor content that is valued by STEEM holders.

Individual websites such as steemit.com may censor content on their particular site, but content published on the blockchain is inherently broadcast traffic and mirrors all around the world may continue to make it available.

Freedom of speech is the foundation of all other liberties and any infringement upon freedom of speech undermines the only peaceful means of reaching consensus: discussion. Without free discussion voters cannot be fully informed, and uninformed voters are a greater threat to society than losing the right to vote. Censorship is a means of stealing votes through limiting public discourse. Steem is committed to enabling free speech and building a free society.

## Solving Organic Discovery via Search Engine Optimization

Most cryptocurrencies generate little value for those who are not actively using the network. Steem, by contrast, generates content and encourages users to share it. This content gets indexed by search engines and ultimately will bring value to a large number of passive users. This search traffic creates organic advertising for the Steem network and grows the network effect.

## Shifting Toward Blockchain-based Attribution

The internet represents the easiest medium for distributing information in the world. With that said, it can be a frightening place for content creators who would like to own their content and have it shared with proper attribution. On current social media platforms, attribution is something that can be lost overnight - a posted video or image can be replicated and re-shared without consent or regard for the creator.

Under blockchain-based social media, a creator or author would always be able to point to a public record and timestamp showing proof of their content origination. In a circumstance where a creator would like to address those who have re-shared without permission or attribution, blockchain-based records provide public proof that the content was posted by a particular user at a particular time. In the future, blockchain-based attribution could come to be recognized by governments for its authenticity and could hold weight in court, which would give content creators greater powers to control their work.

While a timestamping service can be built on almost any blockchain, and several efforts exist to build this kind of service on the Bitcoin network, Steem has a useful advantage in this realm because content publishers are “first class citizens” -- the Steem blockchain is built from the ground up around the use case of content publication, which allows content creators to have the blockchain to validate their content at a certain point in time simply by writing their post using the same authoring tools used by other Steem users.

## Replacing Advertising with Blockchain-based Content Rewards

Under most content monetization models, content creators leverage advertising in one form or another. Many creators recognize how advertising may diminish their work’s value to the consumer, yet creators very often must seek returns on their time by monetizing. Advertising represents a double-edged sword: With ads, a creator can make money most easily. Without ads, monetization is difficult but the content is richer.

Creators posting to social media outlets that are connected to Steem may monetize merely by having their work recognized (or ”liked”) by the Steem community. Blockchain-based payouts are completely digital and have no middle-man. Therefore monetization by blockchain-based content rewards should be faster and much lower barrier to use than monetization by advertisements.

# Conclusion

Steem is an experiment designed to address challenges in the cryptocurrency and social media industries by combining the best aspects from both. Steem presents earning opportunities to content creators and internet readers in ways that have not existed within the social media industry. Within Steem, individuals earn real rewards online that are directly correlated to their contributions. Those rewards may have dollar value due to the market price discovery and liquidity of Steem, and the people who hold Steem may have more exclusive earning powers than those who do not.
