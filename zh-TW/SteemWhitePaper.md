# 簡介

總體而言，用戶生成的內容為社交媒體公司的股東創造了價值數十億美元價值，例如 Reddit，Facebook和Twitter。 **在2014年，Reddit 假設：如果每一個以寫日誌，評論或點贊這種形式向 reddit.com 做出貢獻的個人獎勵一份 Reddit 公司的公平股份，那麼其平台將會得到改進。[^1]**. Steem 的目的是支持社會媒體和在線上社區通過返回許多價值的人提供有價值的貢獻，以回報他們的加密貨幣，並且通過這個過程創造一種貨幣，是能够達成一個廣泛的市場，包括那些沒有參加任何加密貨幣經濟人。 

有一些關鍵原則, 已被用來指導設計的 Steem。 最重要的原則是 每一個人作出貢獻的企業應該得到分配的擁有權, 支付或債務的風險。 這一原則是適用于所有初創公司的原則, 因為它們在創建和隨後的融資回合中分配股份。

第二個原則是所有形式的資本都同樣有價值。 這意味著那些貢獻了他的時間與精力以為他人生產和策劃內容服務的人應該與那些貢獻金錢的人具有同樣的價值。 這就是人力資產原則[^2]同時也是之前的加密貨幣所同樣擁有，經常有麻煩提供給超過幾個人。

第三個原則是 社區生產產品來服務其成員。 這一原則以信用合作社、食品合作社和健康分享計畫為例，它們為社區成員服務, 而不是向社區以外的人銷售產品或服務。

Steem 社區向其成員提供以下服務:

1. 一個優質新聞和時事評論的來源。
2. 為個人化問題獲得高品質答案的一種方法。
3. 一個與​​美元掛鉤的穩定加密貨幣
4. 免費付款。
5. 向其他成員提供上述服務的作業。

Steem 對經濟激勵的有目的的調整, 有可能為所有參與的人帶來更公平和更具包容性的結果, 而不是社會媒體和 加密貨幣 平臺。 本文將探討現有的經濟激勵措施, 並說明蒸汽的激勵措施如何能為大多數參與者帶來更好的結果。

## 確認貢獻

Steem 是一個徹底解決社交媒體經濟的應用與其貨幣化問題而設計的解決方案。 我們的論文是, 使用相同的技術來發展主要的社交媒體平臺可以用來引導一個成功的加密貨幣. 加密货币所啟用的經濟刺激措施可以極大地促進新的社會媒體平臺的發展。 加密货币 和社會媒體之間的協同作用, 我們相信可能給 Steem 一個強大的優勢在市場上。

Steem 面臨的挑戰是得出一個演算法, 用於評分個人貢獻, 大多數社區成員認為是公平評估每項貢獻的主觀價值。 在一個完美的世界裡，社區成員將相互合作，對其他成員的貢獻進行評分並獲得公平的補償。 在現實世界中, 演算法必須以這樣的方式設計, 這樣他們就能抗拒有意操縱利潤。 任何對評分制度的濫用都會導致社區成員對經濟體系的公平性失去信心。

現有平臺以單使用者、一票原則運行。 這就創造了一個環境, 在那裡排名可以由 Sybil 攻擊操縱, 服務提供者必須積極地識別和阻止虐待人。 已經有人試圖操縱Reddit，Facebook，和 Twitter 評分算灋時的回報是網站流量或審查。

Steem 平臺上的基本帳戶單位是 STEEM, 一個加密貨幣權杖。 Steem 以一 Steem 一票的方式運作。 在這種模式下，對平臺貢獻最大的個人，以他們的帳戶餘額衡量，對捐款的得分影響最大。 此外，Steem 只允許成員投票 STEEM 時它是致力於一個歸屬時間表。 在這種模式下，成員們會被激勵而用把 STEEM 幣長期價值最大化的方式來投票。

Steem 是圍繞一個相對簡單的概念的設計: *每個人對社區的有意義的貢獻所增加的價值都應該被認可. *當人們認可他們的有意義的貢獻時，他們繼續貢獻並促進社區增長。 在社區內給予和採取的任何不平衡是不可持續的。 給予者最終會厭倦支持接受者並脫離社區.

面臨的挑戰是建立一個系統，需要能夠確定哪些貢獻的，並且它們的相對價值可以擴展到無限多的人。

一個被證明的評估和獎勵貢獻的系統是自由市場。 自由市場可以被看作是一個單一的社區，每個人都相互交易，報酬由利潤和損失來分配。 市場體系獎勵那些為他人提供價值的人，懲罰那些比他們消費更多價值的人。 自由市場支持許多不同的貨幣，而貨幣只是一種每個人都易於交換的商品。

由於自由市場是一個經過驗證的系統，所以很容易嘗試建立一個自由市場體系，內容消費者直接向內容生產者付費。 然而，直接支付是低效的和不可行創建內容和管理。 大多數內容的價值與認知、財務和機會成本有關，而很少有讀者願意給小費。 自由選擇的豐富意味著實施 付費牆” 將帶動讀者的地方。 有過幾個讀者給作者的每篇文章小額支付嘗試，但沒有一個被普及。

Steem 旨在通過改變經濟方程式來實現對各種貢獻的有效小額支付。 讀者不再需要決定是否要從自己的口袋中支付某人, 而是他們可以投票內容向上或向下, Steem 將使用他們的選票來決定個人獎勵。 这意味着，人们被给予了一个熟悉的和广泛使用的接口，不再面对认知、金融及相关传统小额支付和倾斜平台的机会成本。

社区成员的投票对 Steem 准确地分配捐款是至关重要的。 因此, 投票可以看作是一項重要貢獻, 值得自己獎勵。 某些平台，比如Slashdot，使用 meta-moderation [^3]作為排序和獎勵誠實的評判者的方法。 Steem 選擇獎勵那些對某項內容的宣傳貢獻最大的成員，並且對投票者的獎勵與內容創造者的最終報酬成正比。

# 如何貢獻

本節概述了STEEM背後的想法及其對為STEEM社區提供有意義和可衡量的貢獻的人的獎勵..

## 資本的貢獻

社區可以提供兩項吸引資本的項目：債務和所有權。 當社區萎縮時，當社區增長而失去時，購買所有權的人獲利。 購買債務的人獲得一定的利息，但不能參與社會增長所實現的任何利潤。 這兩種類型的資本捐助對社會的增長和貨幣的價值都是有價值的。 此外，還有兩種方法可以持有所有權：流動和股權。 股權是一個長期的承諾，不能在最短的時間內出售。

Steem 網絡把這些不同的資產類別稱為 Steem（STEEM), Steem 能量（SP), 和Steem美元（SBD）

## Steem (STEEM)

Steem 是賬戶在Steem區塊鏈的基礎單位. 所有其他代幣都從STEEM的價值派生出來。 STEEM 是一種流動性貨幣，因此可以在交易所買賣，也可作為支付方式轉給其他用戶。

## Steem Power (SP)

啟動公司需要長期資本承諾。 那些在初創公司投資的人預期要等好幾年才能賣出股票，實現利潤。 如果沒有長期的承諾，一家試圖通過出售額外股票籌集更多資本的創業公司將與現有股東競爭。 精明的投資者希望自己的資本貢獻能使公司成長, 但如果新資本被給予那些希望退出的人, 經濟增長就不可能實現。

有長期承諾的重要價值，因為它使社區能够製定長期計畫。 利益相關者的長期承諾也促使他們投票支持長期增長，而不是短期投資。

在加密貨幣的領域中，投機者從一種加密貨幣到另外一種加密貨幣的跳轉主要基於哪一種會有預計的短期增長。 Steem 希望建立一個由長期觀點所擁有並完全控制的社區。

使用者可以將他們的 STEEM 提交到十三周的歸屬計畫, 為他們提供在平臺內的額外好處。 STEEM 已承諾十三周的歸屬計畫稱為蒸汽電源 (SP)。 SP 餘額是非轉讓的, 除非通過自動重複的轉換請求, 否則不可整除。 這意味著SP不能輕易地在加密貨幣交易所交易。

當用戶對內容進行投票時，他們對獎勵池分配的影響與他們擁有的SP數量成正比。 有更多 SP 的使用者對獎勵的分配有更多的影響。 這意味著 SP 是一個訪問權杖, 它授予其持有者在蒸汽平臺內的專有許可權。

SP持有人還得到歸屬SP餘額的利息。 5％的年通貨膨脹被用於支付利息給SP所有者。 它們所收到的利息的金額與它們相對於所有使用者的已歸屬 SP 的總金額所持的 SP 數量成正比。

把STEEM轉移到SP被稱為“增加能量”，而從SP轉移到STEEM被稱為“降低能量”。能量降低的SP將在十三週的時間每週等量地被返還給用戶。返還從降低能量啟動的一周以後開始。

## Steem Dollars (SBD)

穩定是成功的全球經濟的一個重要特徵。 如果沒有穩定，世界各地的個人在從事商業和儲蓄時就不會有低的認知成本。 因為穩定是成功的經濟體的一個重要特徵，設計了Steem 美元企圖對加密貨幣的世界，誰使用 Steem 網絡個人帶來穩定。

Steem 美元是由類似于可轉換債券的機制創建的, 通常用於為初創企業提供資金。 在創業市場，可轉換債券是短期債務工具，可以以未來確定的利率轉換為所有權，通常是在未來的融資週期中。 基於區塊鏈的代幣可以被視為社區中的所有權，而可轉換債券可以被視為以任何其他商品或貨幣計價的債務。 可轉換票據的條款允許持有者以令牌的公平市場價格作為最小通知轉換為支持令牌。 創建代幣可轉換美元使區塊鏈能夠在最大化代幣持有者回報的同時增加他們的網絡效果。

Steem 美元是指與符號 SBD, 一個縮寫為 Steem Blockchain 美元。 創建SBD需要結合可靠的飼料價格、和規則，防止濫用。 提供可靠的價格飼料包括三個因素：最大限度地减少不正確的飼料的影響，最大限度地產生錯誤飼料的成本，並儘量減少時間的重要性。

### 最小化欺詐性餵價

SP持有人選舉的個人，作為見證人，公佈餵價。 可以認為，餵價質量的既得利益者，信任被選出的見證人。 通過支付那些被選出來的人, Steem 創造市場競爭來賺取生產飼料的權利。 餵價創造者獲得的報酬越多，他們發布虛假信息的損失就越多。

給定一組受信任和當選的飼料生產商，轉換的實際價格可以作為飼料的中位數。 這樣，如果少數個體飼料生產商產生離群值，它們對實際中值的影響最小，但仍有能力影響它們的聲譽。

即使所有飼料生產商都是誠實的，大多數飼料生產商也有可能受到超出其控制範圍的事件的影響。 Steem 網路旨在容忍中位價格提要的短期腐敗, 而社區則積極努力糾正這一問題。 可能需要一段時間糾正的一個例子是短期市場操縱。 市場操縱是困難和昂貴的維持長期的時間。 另一個例子是集中交換失敗或交易所發佈的資料損壞。

Steem 通過使用三天以上的中位價格來影響短期價格波動。中位公佈的提要每小時採樣一次。

只要價格腐敗的持續時間不到移動中值時間窗的一半，它將對轉換價格的影響最小。 如果飼料確實變質了，網絡參與者將有機會在腐敗飼料影響實際轉換價格之前將腐敗飼料生產商投出去。 也許更重要的是, 它給飼料生產者一個機會, 以發現和糾正問題之前, 他們的飼料開始影響價格。

有一個三天半的視窗，社區成員有大約一天半的時間來回答任何出現的問題。

### 緩解定時攻擊

市場參與者獲取資訊的速度比 blockchain 的三天半的移動中值轉換價格的反應。 這些資訊可以用來造福於交易者，而損害了整個社會。 如果 STEEM 交易商的價值突然增加, 可以要求他們的 SBD 在舊的, 較低的價格, 然後出售的 STEEM, 他們得到了一個新的更高的價格與最低的風險。

Steem 通過要求所有轉換請求延遲三天來對遊戲場進行級別調整。 這意味著，無論是商人還是blockchain有任何資訊優勢對於當時轉換價格執行。

### 最小化轉換的濫用

如果人們可以自由轉換的兩個方向然後交易者可以利用的blockchains轉換率交易量大價格沒有變化。 那些看到價格大幅上漲的交易員會以高價 (最危險的時候) 轉換為 SBD, 然後在調整後轉換回來。 Steem 協定只允許 從 SBD 轉換為 STEEM, 而不是以另一種方式來保護社區免遭這種虐待。

Blockchain 决定如何以及何時創建SBD和誰應該得到它。這使SBD創造穩定率和消除濫用的途徑。

### 可持續債務到擁有權比率

如果一個代幣被視為整個代幣供應的所有權，那麼代幣可兌換美元就可以被視為債務。 如果債務與所有權比率過高，整個貨幣就會變得不穩定。 債務轉換可以極大地新增代幣供應，而這反過來又在市場上抑制價格。 隨後的轉換需要發行更多的代幣。 如果不受控制，系統會崩潰並留下堆積如山的債務所背書的毫無價值的所有權。 債務與所有權比率越高，新的投資者就越不願意投資。

STEEM 價值的快速變化可以顯著改變債務與擁有權的比率。 Blockchain 防止債務與擁有權的比率過高, 通過通過 SBD 轉換來減少 STEEM 的金額, 如果債務水準超過10%。 If the amount of SBD debt ever exceeds 10% of the total STEEM market cap, the blockchain will automatically reduce the amount of STEEM generated through conversions to a maximum of 10% of the market cap. This ensures that the blockchain will never have higher than a 10% debt-to-ownership ratio.

The percentage floors used to compute STEEM creation are based on the supply including the STEEM value of all outstanding SBD and SP (as determined by the current rate / feed).

### Interest

SBD pays holders interest. The interest rate is set by the same people who publish the price feed so that it can adapt to changing market conditions. All debt carries risk to the lender. Someone who holds SBD without redeeming it is effectively lending the community the value of a dollar. They are trusting that at some point in the future someone will be willing to buy the SBD from them for a dollar or that there will be speculators and investors willing to buy the STEEM they convert it into.

STEEM and SP holders gain leverage when members of the community are willing to hold SBD. This leverage amplifies the gains from growth while also contributing to growth. STEEM holders do suffer from increased dilution if the price falls. Cryptocurrency projects have shown that the gains from increasing the user base willing to trust the network with capital ultimately add more value to the network than any dilution that may occur during a downturn.

### Setting Price Feeds

Astute readers will recognize that an interest bearing asset of limited supply may trade higher or lower than the underlying asset depending upon other opportunities to earn interest on the same asset. With a high interest rate paid on an asset pegged to the US dollar many people will bid up the limited supply of Steem Dollars until they are no longer valued at $1. In economics there is a principle known as the Impossible Trinity[^4] which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:

1. A stable exchange rate
2. Free capital movement
3. An independent monetary policy

If Steem feed producers aim to have an independent monetary policy allowing it to create and destroy Steem Dollars while simultaneously having full control over the interest rate then they will encounter problems. The Impossible Trinity says that Steem Dollars either need to restrict capital movement, have an unstable exchange rate with the dollar, or have limited control over the interest rate.

The primary concern of Steem feed producers is to maintain a stable one-to-one conversion between SBD and the U.S. Dollar (USD). Any time SBD is consistently trading above $1.00 USD interest payments must be stopped. In a market where 0% interest on debt still demands a premium, it is safe to say the market is willing to extend more credit than the debt the community is willing to take on. If this happens a SBD will be valued at more than $1.00 and there is little the community can do without charging negative interest rates.

If the debt-to-ownership ratio is low and SBD is trading for less than $1.00, then the interest rate should be increased. This will encourage more people to hold their SBD and support the price.

If SBD trades for less than $1.00 USD and the debt-to-ownership ratio is high, then the feeds should be adjusted upward give more STEEM per SBD. This will increase demand for SBD while also reducing the debt-to-ownership ratio and returning SBD to parity with USD.

Assuming the value of STEEM is growing faster than Steem is creating new SBD, the debt-to-ownership ratio should remain under the target ratio and the interest offered benefits everyone. If the value of the network is flat or falling, then any interest offered will only make the debt-to-ownership ratio worse.

In effect, feed producers are entrusted with the responsibility of setting monetary policy for the purpose of maintaining a stable peg to the USD. Abuse of this power can harm the value of STEEM so SP holders are wise to vote for witnesses that can be counted on to adjust the price feed and interest rates according to the rules outlined above.

If the debt-to-ownership ratio gets dangerously high and market participants choose to avoid conversion requests, then the feed should be adjusted to increase the rate at which STEEM paid for converting SBD.

Changes to the interest rate policy and/or any premiums/discounts on the STEEM/SBD conversion rate should be a slow and measured response to long-term average deviations rather than attempting to respond to short-term market conditions.

It is our belief that these rules will give market participants confidence that they are unlikely lose money by holding SBD purchased at a price of $1.00. We fully expect there to be a narrow trading range between $0.95 and $1.05 for SBD under normal market conditions.

## Subjective Contributions

Subjective Proof of Work presents an alternative approach to distributing a currency that improves upon fully *objective* Proof of Work systems such as mining. The applications of a currency implementing *subjective* proof of work are far wider than any *objective* proof of work system because they can be applied to build a community around any concept that has a sufficiently defined purpose. When individuals join a community they buy into a particular set of beliefs and can vote to reinforce the community values or purpose.

In effect, the criteria by which work is evaluated is completely subjective and its definition lives outside the source code itself. One community may wish to reward artists, another poets, and another comedians. Other communities may choose to reward charitable causes or help advance political agendas.

The value each currency achieves depends upon the demand for influence within a particular community and how large the market believes each community can get. Unlike prior systems, subjective proof of work enables a community to collectively fund the development of whatever it finds valuable and enables the monetization of previously non monetizable time.

### Distributing Currency

There are two ways people can get involved with a crypto-currency community: they can *buy in*, or they can *work in*. In both cases users are adding value to the currency, however, the vast majority of people have more *free time* than they do *spare cash*. Imagine the goal of bootstrapping a currency in a poor community with no actual *cash* but plenty of *time*. If people can earn money by working for one another then they will bootstrap value through mutual exchange facilitated by a fair accounting/currency system.

Distributing a currency to as many people as possible in a manner that is generally perceived as fair is a challenging task. The tasks that can be entirely evaluated by an objective computer algorithm are limited in nature and generally speaking have limited positive external benefits. In the case of Bitcoin-style mining, it can result in the production of specialized hardware and cause people to invest time developing more efficient algorithms. It may even help find prime numbers, but none of these things provide meaningful value to society or the currency holding community at large. More importantly, economies of scale and market forces will end up excluding everyone but experts from participating in this kind of distribution. Ultimately, computation-based mining is just another way of *buying in* because it requires money to pay the electric bill or the development of hardware necessary to do the work.

In order to give everyone an equal opportunity to get involved and earn the currency people must be given an opportunity to work. The challenge is how to judge the relative quality and quantity of work that individuals provide and to do so in a way that efficiently allocates rewards to millions of users. This requires the introduction of a scalable voting process. In particular it requires that authority to allocate funds must be as distributed and decentralized as possible.

The first step in rewarding millions of users is to commit to distributing a fixed amount of currency regardless of how much work is actually done or how users vote. This changes the question from being *“Should we pay?”* to *“Whom should we pay?”* and signals to the market that money is being distributed and is being auctioned off to whoever “bids” the most *work*. This is similar to Bitcoin committing to award 50 BTC to whoever finds the most difficult hashes. Like Bitcoin, all work must be done prior-to payout and nothing should be paid speculatively on the promise to do work in the future.

The next step is to reward everyone who does anything even remotely positive with *something*. This is accomplished by ranking all work done and distributing proportionally to its value. The more competitive the market becomes, the more difficult (higher quality or quantity) it becomes to earn the same payout.

### Voting on Distribution of Currency

Assume there is a fixed amount of money to distribute, and that those who have a long-term vested interest in the future value and utility of the currency are the ones who must decide how to allocate it. Every vesting user casts their votes on who did the best work and at the end of the day the available money for that day is divided proportional to the votes such that everyone with even one net positive vote gets something.

The naive voting process creates a N-Person Prisoner’s Dilemma[^5] whereby each individual voter has incentive to vote for themselves at the expense of the larger community goal. If every voter defects by voting for themselves then no currency will end up distributed and the currency as a whole will fail to gain network effect. On the other hand, if only one voter defects then that voter would win undeserved profits while having minimal effect on the overall value of the currency.

#### Voting Abuse

Regardless of how much money any one individual has, there are always many other individuals with similar wealth. Even the wealthiest individual rarely has much more than the next couple wealthiest combined. Furthermore, those who have a large investment in a community also have the most to lose by attempting to game the voting system for themselves. It would be like the CEO of a company deciding to stop paying salaries so he could pocket all of the profits. Everyone would leave to work for other companies and the company would become worthless, leaving the CEO bankrupt rather than wealthy.

Fortunately, any work that is getting a large concentration of votes is also gaining the most scrutiny (publicity). Through the addition of *negative-voting* it is possible for many smaller stakeholders to nullify the voting power of collusive groups or defecting large stakeholders. Furthermore, large-stakeholders have more to lose if the currency falls in value due to abuse than they might gain by voting for themselves. In fact, honest large stakeholders are likely to be more effective by policing abuse and using negative voting than they would be by voting for smaller contributions.

The use of *negative-voting* to keep people from abusing the system leverages the *crab mentality* that many people have when it is perceived that one individual is profiting at the expense of everyone else. While crab mentality normally refers to short-sighted people keeping good people down, it is also what allows good people to keep bad people down. The only “problem” with crab mentality is when people *wrongly believe* someone is profiting at everyone else's expense.

**The Story of the Crab Bucket**[^6]

A man was walking along the beach and saw another man fishing in the surf with a bait bucket beside him. As he drew closer, he saw that the bait bucket had no lid and had live crabs inside.

"Why don't you cover your bait bucket so the crabs won't escape?", he said.

"You don't understand.", the man replied, "If there is one crab in the bucket it would surely crawl out very quickly. However, when there are many crabs in the bucket, if one tries to crawl up the side, the others grab hold of it and pull it back down so that it will share the same fate as the rest of them."

So it is with people. If one tries to do something different, get better grades, improve herself, escape her environment, or dream big dreams, other people will try to drag her back down to share their fate.

Eliminating “abuse” is not possible and shouldn’t be the goal. Even those who are attempting to “abuse” the system are still doing work. Any compensation they get for their successful attempts at abuse or collusion is at least as valuable for the purpose of distributing the currency as the make-work system employed by traditional Bitcoin mining or the collusive mining done via mining pools. All that is necessary is to ensure that abuse isn’t so rampant that it undermines the incentive to do real work in support of the community and its currency.

The goal of building a community currency is to get more “crabs in the bucket”. Going to extreme measures to eliminate all abuse is like attempting to put a lid on the bucket to prevent a few crabs from escaping and comes at the expense of making it harder to add new crabs to the bucket. It is sufficient to make the walls slippery and give the other crabs sufficient power to prevent others from escaping.

### Rate Limited Voting

A major part of minimizing abuse is the rate-limiting of voting. Individual users can only read and evaluate so many work items per day. Any attempt to vote more frequently than this is a sign of automation and potential abuse. Through rate limiting, stakeholders who vote more frequently have each vote count for less than stakeholders who vote less frequently. Attempts to divide tokens among multiple accounts also divides influence and therefore does not result in a net increase in influence nor bypass the rate-limit imposed on voting.

Users are allotted a fixed amount of voting power. Voting power is multiplied by a user’s vesting tokens to determine how much share in the reward pool should be allocated to a given work item. Every vote that is cast uses a percentage of remaining voting power. Users can vote for more posts, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again. Voting power recharges at a fixed linear rate of 20% per day.

### Payout Distribution

One of the primary goals of Steem’s reward system is to produce the best discussions on the internet. Each and every year 75% of the yearly inflation is distributed to users submitting, voting on, and discussing content. At the size of Bitcoin this could be several million dollars per day being given to the top contributors.

The actual distribution will depend upon the voting patterns of users, but we suspect that the vast majority of the rewards will be distributed to the most popular content.

Zipf’s Law[^7] is one of those empirical rules that characterize a surprising range of real-world phenomena remarkably well. It says that if we order some large collection by size or popularity, the second element in the collection will be about half the measure of the first one, the third one will be about one-third the measure of the first one, and so on. In general, the k th-ranked item will measure about 1/k of the first one.

![](\img_the_new_marketplace.png)

Taking popularity as a rough measure of value, then the value of each individual item is given by Zipf’s Law. That is, if we have a million items, then the most popular 100 will contribute a third of the total value, the next 10,000 another third, and the remaining 989,900 the final third. The value of the collection of n items is proportional to log(n).

The impact of this voting and payout distribution is to offer large bounties for good content while still rewarding smaller players for their long-tail contribution.

The economic effect of this is similar to a lottery where people overestimate their probability of getting votes and thus do more work than the expected value of their reward and thereby maximize the total amount of work performed in service of the community. The fact that everyone “wins something” plays on the same psychology that casinos use to keep people gambling. In other words, small rewards help reinforce the idea that it is possible to earn bigger rewards.

### Payouts

When a post receives a payout it takes the form of 50% SBD and 50% SP. The Steem Power give the user increased voting and transaction power while the SBD gives the user an immediate benefit in a stable currency. As we’ve already discussed at length, SP is designed to encourage long-term holding rather than short-term selling. This encourages more users to have a vested interest in the long-term success of the platform.

Users also have the option to be paid in 100% SP, as well as decline payout on posts. When a user declines payout on a post, the money that would have been paid to them remains in the rewards pool, to be distributed to other users.

# Consensus Algorithm

Consensus is the process by which a community comes to a universally recognized, unambiguous agreement on piece of information. There are many algorithms society has developed for reaching consensus about who owns what. Every government on earth is a primitive consensus algorithm whereby the population agrees to abide by a certain set of rules enshrined in a constitution. Governments establish courts, judges, and juries to interpret the subjective facts and render a final decision. Most of the time people abide by the decision even if it was wrong.

The algorithms used by cryptocurrencies provide a better way to reach consensus. Cryptographically signed testimony from individuals is recorded in a public ledger that establishes the absolute global order of events. A deterministic computer algorithm can then process this ledger to derive a universally accepted conclusion. So long as the members of a community agree on the processing algorithm, the result of the algorithm is authoritative.

The primary consideration is determining what testimony is allowed to enter the public record. Systems should be designed to minimize the potential for censorship. Censorship on the public ledger is similar to preventing someone from voting in an election. In both cases an individual is prevented from impacting the global consensus.

## Consensus in Steem

Conceptually, the consensus algorithm adopted by Steem is similar to the consensus algorithm adopted by companies throughout the world. People with a vested interest in the future value of Steem vote to select individuals responsible for including testimony in the public record. Voting is weighted proportional to each individual's vested interest.

In the world of cryptocurrencies, the public record is commonly referred to as a *blockchain*. A *block* is a group of signed transactions.

With Steem, block production is done in rounds. Each round 21 witnesses are selected to create and sign blocks of transactions. Twenty (20) of these witnesses are selected by approval voting and one is timeshared by every witness that didn’t make it into the top 20 proportional to their total votes. The 21 active witnesses are shuffled every round to prevent any one witness from constantly ignoring blocks produced by the same witness placed before. Any witness who misses a block and hasn't produced in the last 24 hours will be disabled until they update their block signing key.

This process is designed to provide the best reliability while ensuring that everyone has the potential to participate in block production regardless of whether they are popular enough to get voted to the top. People have three options to overcome censorship by the top 20 elected witnesses: patiently wait in line with everyone else not in the top 20, or purchase more SP to improve voting power. Generally speaking, applying censorship is a good way for elected witnesses to lose their job and therefore, it is unlikely to be a real problem on the Steem network.

Because the active witnesses are known in advance, Steem is able to schedule witnesses to produce blocks every 3 seconds. Witnesses synchronize their block production via the NTP protocol. A variation of this algorithm has been in use by the BitShares network for over a year where it has been proven to be reliable.

# Eliminating Transaction Fees

Steem goes to great lengths to reward people for contributing to the network. It would be counterproductive to turn around and charge people every time they attempt to interact with the community.

Blockchain technology currently depends upon transaction fees to prevent spam. These fees suffer all of the known problems with microtransactions and prevent blockchains from being used for low-value transactions. Truly decentralized applications must offer users the appearance of free transactions if they wish to compete with their centralized alternatives. This paper outlines the approach used by Steem to eliminate the need for fees and thereby enable a wide range of previously untenable decentralized applications.

## The Problem With Fees

Blockchains are decentralized networks where all transactions are broadcast to all peers. Every so often a block is produced that includes some or all of the pending transactions. All blockchains must find a solution to prevent malicious users from consuming all of the available network capacity with worthless transactions. These worthless transactions can prevent other valuable transactions from being processed and ultimately destroy the network.

The solution adopted by most blockchains thus far is to charge a minimum transaction fee. A fee worth just a few cents is enough to make attacking the network expensive and unprofitable. While this approach solves the spam problem, it introduces new problems. Imagine solving the email spam problem by introducing a small fee on every email; people wouldn’t use email.

### Micropayments Don’t Work

The fundamental problem with charging transaction fees is that micropayments don’t work, especially for low-value user actions. When a fee is charged on every transaction, it limits the types of transactions that a decentralized network can process. Regardless of how rational the argument for the necessity of fees, users still hate the experience of being nickeled and dimed for everything that they do.

Imagine if the websites we use every day charged us a fee every time we modify our accounts by changing the password. Users expect certain things to be free. Requiring users to make a decision on whether or not an action is worth a small fee creates anxiety that causes users to leave. A transaction can’t be worth so much as to require a decision but worth so little that that decision is automatic. There is a certain amount of anxiety involved in any decision to buy, no matter how small, and it derives not from the interface used or the time required, but from the very act of deciding.

Micropayments, like all payments, require a comparison: *“Is this much of X worth that much of Y?”* There is a minimum mental transaction cost created by this fact that cannot be optimized away, because the only transaction a user will be willing to approve with no thought will be one that costs them nothing, which is no transaction at all.

– Clay Shirky[^8]

In the world of financial payments, small fees are acceptable because the value of the transaction is extremely high relative to the fee charged, and the buyer has already made a decision to buy. The world of potential blockchain applications is far greater than just financial payments and includes many necessary transactions for which fees are simply unacceptable to users.

Systems like BitShares, Nxt, Ripple, Counter Party and Stellar all allow users to place limit orders on the blockchain and all of them charge users a small fee to perform this action. Later if the user wishes to cancel their order, another fee is charged. Systems like Ethereum take micropayments to a whole new level: charging per calculation. All of these systems struggle to attract new mainstream users for the same reasons that a decentralized search engine would struggle to attract users from Google if it charged a small fee for every search. It doesn’t matter how good the service is, people expect certain things to be free. This is true even if a user ends up paying more overall under a different fee structure.

### Fees are a Barrier to Entry

Any fee creates a barrier to entry for new users. Before someone can experiment with Ethereum they must acquire some ETH tokens. Anyone wanting to build a decentralized application on Ethereum must pass on the cost to their customers. Buying a crypto currency is not an easy task and rarely makes sense for amounts less than $10. This means that new users wanting to try out a new decentralized application must first be convinced to part with $10.

### Changing Fees

Over time a network must adjust fees. This can happen either due to an increase in the value of the token or due to a surge in capacity. Users like predictable fees and guaranteed service. While it is possible to dynamically adjust fees during times of heavy use, the result is a poor user experience.

### Sybil Attacks

Centralized websites prevent spam through rate limiting and some form of ID verification. Even something as simple as reCAPTCHA[^9] is sufficient to limit the creation of fake accounts. If someone abuses their account then centralized websites are free to block the account.

In a decentralized system there is no direct way to ban users nor centralized provider able to host a reCAPTCHA and enforce rate limiting of accounts. In fact, the inability to censor users is one of the main selling points of blockchain technology.

### Full Reserve vs Fractional Reserve

Let’s view a blockchain like an Internet Service Provider (ISP) co-op which owns all of the cables in the town and has a maximum amount of bandwidth that it can provide at any time. People living in the town can buy shares in the ISP and in exchange they are entitled to utilize a portion of the available bandwidth.

The ISP has two choices, run a “full reserve” or “fractional reserve” system. Under a full reserve system each user is only allowed a fraction of the maximum bandwidth proportional to her shares. Because not everyone uses the Internet at the same time, the town’s network would be significantly underutilized.

Under a fractional reserve system the individual users could utilize more bandwidth than they are entitled to at any given point in time so long as not everyone uses the Internet at the same time. The problem with operating a fractional reserve is that congestion occurs anytime too many people wish to use the network at the same time. The ISP needs a way to prioritize bandwidth during congested periods. In the most extreme case, a fully congested network must revert to a full reserve system. The challenge is setting the proper fractional reserve ratio.

## Bandwidth Instead of Micropayment Channels

The solution to the problems with micropayments is in implementing *dynamic fractional reserves*. Under this model the blockchain will automatically adjust the reserve ratio for the network during times of congestion. The blockchain will set a target utilization that leaves enough headroom for short term surges in demand. Any time the surges are sustained the blockchain reduces the maximum bandwidth-per-share. When a surge is over and there is surplus capacity the blockchain can slowly increase the bandwidth-per-share.

Bandwidth used by an individual user should be measured over a suitably long period of time to allow that user to time-shift their usage. Users tend to login, do many things at once, then logout. This means that their bandwidth over a short period of time may appear much higher than if viewed over a longer period of time. If the time window is stretched too far then the reserve ratio will not adjust fast enough to respond to short-term surges, if the window is too short then clustering usage will have too big of an impact on normal users.

In our estimate it should be sufficient to measure the average weekly bandwidth usage of users. Every time a user signs a transaction, that transaction is factored into their own individual moving average. Any time a user’s moving average exceeds the current network limit their transaction is delayed until their average falls below the limit.

### Impact of Capacity

Blockchain capacity isn’t necessarily capped. It is well within the technological capability of internet infrastructure to increase the Bitcoin block size to 10MB which in turn will reduce the minimum required balance by a factor of 10. While Bitcoin currently supports about 3 transactions per second, alternative implementations are capable of over 1000 transactions per second.

### Comparison to Fees

If we assume a user with $25 dollars worth of BTC transacts once per week and pays a $0.04 cent fee each time then they would pay over $2.00 in fees per year. A user would have to earn a 8% rate of return on their $25 dollars just to break even with paying fees. Chances are that users were going to hold their money on the blockchain anyway, so this user with $25 worth of BTC just saved $2 over the course of a year by adopting a rate-limiting approach rather than a fee-based approach. With just $175 they could transact every single day and save $14 per year.

### Account Creation

Steem’s account-based system with publicly known balances simplifies the implementation of the bandwidth-based rate limiting algorithm. Any account with a balance below the minimum required to transact once per week would be unable to transact. This implies that all new accounts should be funded with at least this minimum balance. It also implies that users wishing to transact in smaller amounts can, so long as they hold a larger balance and reuse the account.

It is possible for a low-balance account created during a time of low usage to become inaccessible if the network usage picks up. The funds could be recovered at any time by temporarily delegating a larger balance to the account.

In order to maintain a reasonable user experience with a minimum number of hung accounts, all new accounts should start out with a balance 10 times the minimum required to transact weekly. This way even if demand increases by a factor of 10 the account will remain viable.

Any initial account balance would have to come from the user creating the account and not from token creation due to the potential for sybil attacks.

### Justifying Minimum Balances

The concept of forcing users to maintain a minimum balance flows naturally from the value of a user[^10]. Anyone running a business knows that every single user has significant value. Businesses spend anywhere from $30 to $200 to acquire a user. Sometimes they pay users directly, other times they pay for advertizing, and still other times entire companies are bought just for their user base. After a company acquires a user they often given them many *free services* just to keep them around long enough to monetize them through some other means.

Ripple uses a minimum balance[^11] that scales with account resource use and requires that new accounts get funded with at least this minimum balance. Currently this minimum balance is about $0.15 which is greater than the $0.10 we estimated would allow someone to transact freely at least once per week.

A blockchain can enforce a minimum value per user through the simple process of requiring a minimum balance. Any business that wishes to bring a new customer to the blockchain can pre-fund that user’s account with the minimum balance that would allow them to transact. Requiring a relatively large fee ($1.00) to sign up new users will naturally force anyone offering free accounts to vet the quality and uniqueness of each account before registering them with the blockchain.

Maintaining a minimum balance is effectively the same as making users pay transaction fees with the interest they could have earned on their balance. The minimum balance is simply the balance required to earn enough interest to pay a fee in a relatively short period of time.

Fortunately, the minimum balance required can be as low as a dollar and this is something users can understand and appreciate. The opportunity cost of lost interest doesn’t incur the cognitive cost of a micro-fee and is far more acceptable to users.

The STEEM used to pre-fund an account is Powered Up in the new account (i.e., converted to Steem Power). A portion of the SP used to fund a new account may be delegated from the creator of the account. When a user is delegated SP, they may use the SP for voting and bandwidth purposes as if it were their own, but the ownership of the SP remains with the user who delegated it. A user may remove the delegation at any time. After a cool-down period, the SP is returned to their account.

### Effectiveness Relative to Fees

To compare the effectiveness of rate limiting to fees we must consider how the two systems react to intentional network flooding by an attacker. Under Bitcoin an attacker with $10,000 dollars could disrupt service for an entire day by filling every single block. The same attacker would be unable to disrupt service for even a single block under the dynamic fractional reserve rate limiting approach.

If we go to a more extreme case and assume the attacker holds 1% of all coins then we presume an attacker with $60 million dollars. Such an attacker could deny the Bitcoin blockchain service for 16 years unless the miners increased fees or capacity. Even if fees were raised to $15 per transaction, the attacker could still keep the network flooded for 16 days.

Under the rate limiting approach, someone who holds 1% of all coins with an intent to flood the network would achieve their goal for less than 30 seconds.

### Renting vs. Buying vs. Time Sharing

When someone owns a house they expect the right to use the house for free. If a group of people buy a house together then each can expect the right to use the house proportional to their percentage ownership in the house. A fee based blockchain is like renting the house from its owners, whereas rate limiting is like a timeshare among owners.

If a house is owned by multiple people then those individuals must decide how they wish to timeshare the house. Someone who owns 50% of the house but only uses it one weekend per year might expect to be paid by the individuals who take their unused time. This is the mindset of a fee based system.

On the other hand, someone who owns 50% of the house is speculating that demand for the house will increase in the future and they will be able to sell their stake for more. Any owner who owns more of a house than they use becomes a real estate speculator. With this mindset rather than collecting rent, they collect appreciation.

The value of a share is derived from how much time it can potentially grant its owner. Owning 1% of a house and getting it 1 weekend per year is the lowest value of a share. However, if half of the shareholders never use their weekend, then the value per timeshare rises to 2 weekends per year. If those inactive users instead opt to rent their unused time, then it falls back to 1 weekend per year. If those unused timeshares were sold to people who would use them then the value of a timeshare would fall by 50%. Unless the rent collected is greater than the fall in share value the timeshare owners are making an economic miscalculation.

Using this rationale we can assume that a system based on fees will either be more expensive for its users or be less profitable for its collective owners. An individual small owner may profit by renting out his small time slice, but only at the expense of all other timeshare owners. In effect, the cost of the falling timeshare value is shared among all owners whereas the profits are centralized in the single owner who decided to rent his share.

We can conclude from this that a blockchain is best served by not using usage fees at all. If a usage fee were to be charged as an alternative to rate limiting, then it should be the equivalent of buying enough timeshares and committing to hold them long enough to gain the right use it once.

Stated another way, a transaction fee should be equal to the minimum account balance necessary to transact once per week and it should be refunded at the end of the week. Assume the minimum account balance is $1 and allows someone to transact once per week. If someone with a $1 balance that wishes to perform 5 transactions at once they will have to increase their balance to $5 for a week either before or after their transactions.

In theory a market could form where users can borrow the stake required. In practice it is more efficient for users to simply buy and sell the timeshares necessary to meet their desired usage rate. In other words, the cost of negotiating micro-loans is greater than the cost of maintaining a balance suitable for your maximum weekly usage.

Decentralized rate limiting of transactions can enable new types of decentralized applications that were not viable when every use of the application required a micropayment. This new model gives application developers the ability to decide if and when to charge their users for transactions.

# Performance and Scalability

The Steem network is built upon Graphene, the same technology that powers BitShares. Graphene has been publicly demonstrated sustaining over 1000 transactions per second on a distributed test network. Graphene can easily scale to 10,000 or more transactions per second with relatively straightforward improvements to server capacity and communication protocols.

## Reddit Scale

Steem is capable of handling a larger userbase than Reddit. In 2015 Reddit’s 8.7 million users generated an average of 23 comments per second[^12], with an average of 83 comments per year per user. There were 73 million top-level posts, for an average of 2 new posts per second. There were about 7 billion up votes creating an average voting rate of 220 votes per second. All told, if Reddit were operating on a blockchain it would require an average of 250 transactions per second.

To achieve this industry-leading performance, Steem has borrowed lessons learned from the LMAX Exchange[^13], which is able to process 6 million transactions per second. Among these lessons are the following key points:

1. Keep everything in memory.
2. Keep the core business logic in a single thread.
3. Keep cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) out of the core business logic.
4. Divide validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks.
5. Use an object oriented data model.

By following these simple rules, Steem is able to process 10,000 transactions per second without any significant effort devoted to optimization.

Keeping everything in memory is increasingly viable given the recent introduction of Optane™ technology from Intel[^14]. It should be possible for commodity hardware to handle all of the business logic associated with Steem in a single thread with all posts kept in memory for rapid indexing. Even Google keeps their index of the entire internet in RAM. The use of blockchain technology makes it trivial to replicate the database to many machines to prevent loss of data. As Optane™ technology takes over, RAM will become even faster while gaining persistence. In other words, Steem is designed for the architectures of the future and is designed to scale.

# Allocation & Supply

## Initial Allocation & Supply

The Steem network started with a currency supply of 0 and allocated STEEM via proof of work at a rate of approximately 40 STEEM per minute to miners, with an additional 40 STEEM per minute being created to seed the content and curation reward pools (for a total of 80 STEEM per minute). Then the network started rewarding users who converted to SP. At this point, STEEM grew at a rate of approximately 800 STEEM per minute due to the combined effects of the various Contribution Rewards summarized below:

Contribution Rewards:

- Curation rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 3.875% per year, whichever is greater
- Content Creation rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 3.875% per year, whichever is greater
- Block production rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater
- POW inclusion rewards before block 864,000: 1 STEEM per block (awarded as 21 STEEM per round)
- POW inclusion rewards after block 864,000: 0.0476 STEEM per block (awarded as 1 STEEM per round) or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater.
- Liquidity rewards: 1 STEEM per block (awarded as 1200 STEEM per hour) or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater

### Power Rewards:

- Steem Power rewards: For each STEEM created by the above rewards, 9 STEEM are divided among all Steem Power holders.

### SBD operations:

- SBD rewards: A percentage of SBD value is created at an APR set by the witnesses and paid to SBD holders as SBD

The overall supply picture is complicated by the effect of SBD operations, which may result in large-scale creation or destruction of STEEM through feed rate following and SBD rewards, as discussed in the SBD section. Other, smaller-scale complicating effects also exist, including unclaimed incentives (e.g. block rewards for missed blocks), and abandoned accounts.

## Current Allocation & Supply

Starting with the network's 16th hard fork in December 2016, Steem began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 16 went into effect.

75% of the new tokens that are generated go to fund the reward pool, which is split between authors and curators. 15% of the new tokens are awarded to holders of SP. The remaining 10% pays for the witnesses to power the blockchain.

### Impact of Token Creation Rate

It is often said that a coin with an inflationary model is not sustainable, but we know from countless real-world examples that the quantity of money does not have a direct and immediate impact on its value, though it certainly plays a role.

From August 2008 through January 2009 the U.S. money supply[^15] grew from $871B to $1,737B, a rate of over 100% per year and then continued to grow at about 20% per year for the next 6 years. All told the money supply in the U.S. has grown by 4.59x over less than 7 years. During that same time, the value of the dollar relative to goods and services has fallen less than 10% according to the government's price index[^16]. This real-world example demonstrates that supply is only one component of price.

For the first 2 years of Bitcoin’s life the network sustained an annual inflation rate[^17] of over 100%. For the first 5 years it was over 30%, and for the first 8 years it was over 10%. All told the total “spending” Steem does to fund content, curation, and block production amounts to less than 10% APR.

The price of a digital commodity, like STEEM, is driven by both supply and demand. When a long-term holder decides to exit, the supply of STEEM on the market will increase and push the price down. This downward pressure is countered when a new long-term holder decides to buy up the STEEM and convert it back into SP. Additional supply and demand may be be added due to market speculators buying and selling liquid STEEM based on their predictions of the future market price.

# The Power of Steem

Steem recognizes that the value of all user contributions (posts and votes) is greater than the sum of the parts. A single comment is worth next to nothing, but millions of curated posts is worth many millions (or possibly even billions) of dollars. A single vote provides little curation value, but billions of votes is very effective curation. Content without curation is of limited value. Given all the content of the Internet minus the links between it, Google would struggle to produce useful search results. It is the links between information that give it significant value.

Because everyone benefits, everyone should pay. In other words, no individual user should be expected to pay for anything, but instead should be paid for everything they do that brings value to Steem. All we need to do is ascertain which user contributions bring a social network value and which ones don’t.

Collectively Reddit users vote 220 times per second and make 23 posts per second. Reddit is valued between $500 million[^18] and $4 billion[^19] which means that each and every upvote and post is worth between $0.06 and $0.50 assuming the value of Reddit is mostly within the past year’s worth of activity. One could argue that most of the value of Reddit is the near-real-time discussions that have occurred within the past week which would dramatically increase the value of new activity. People go where people are today, not where people were last year.

## No Micropayments, Tips Optional

Existing attempts at integrating a cryptocurrency into a social media platform have focused on enabling users to pay one another. Many services have attempted to introduce tipping. The theory is that if we make tipping simple enough then more people will do it. Other services attempt to get people to pay to promote or boost their content’s ranking. Still others attempt to build small prediction markets on how many tips an article will receive.

All of these approaches boil down to micropayments. They differ only in who is making the payment. They all suffer from insufficient engagement of people making the micropayments. In the search for incentivised content production entrepreneurs have been so focused on who should pay that they missed the obvious reality: everyone benefits from everyone’s actions so everyone should pay or no one should pay, depending on how you look at it.

Steem bypasses micropayments completely because when a user upvotes a post it is the community that pays the bill. The same amount of money will be spent whether the user upvotes a post or not and the funds will not come from the voter.

The mental energy associated with making an economic decision becomes a barrier to participation for most people.

*We already face a multitude of choices everyday with regards to what to access online in this digital era of the information explosion, and every additional decision that we must make simply adds on to the uncertainty and anxiety we face. Micropayment supporters believe that a simplified implementation can minimize the intrusiveness of micropayments and improve user experience, but their argument only creates double standards for the decision making process \[2\]. A transaction cannot simultaneously be worth enough to warrant a decision and worth so little that the decision is automatic. **The only transactions that users can approve without thought are ones that cost them nothing**, thus any micro-transaction of positive value will incur mental costs through its requiring a decision. Furthermore, mental transaction costs actually rise below a certain threshold value, a phenomenon that places micropayments at an even greater disadvantage. For instance, it is easy to think that a copy of today's newspapers costs $1, but readers face much more difficulty and anxiety in deciding on the value of each article or word. Such a dilemma will only be replicated and exacerbated if all online content were to be broken down into their components and individually valued within a micropayment system.*

-Micropayments: A Viable Business Model[^20]

Under Steem, micropayments are paid to content producer, but those who vote for the content do not pay. Instead, the cost of the reward is paid for via new tokens. Someone can join the system, vote to pay someone, and then exit the system with more money than they started with (assuming the market valuation of the Steem system remained constant). In other words, the micropayment solution provided by Steem provides a user-experience similar to many widely used websites that have user-moderated content.

Furthemore, Steem pays people to figure out who should be paid! This kind of thinking is revolutionary.

## Value is in the Links

The Internet would lose the vast majority of its value if all links among content were removed. It is the relationship among web pages that allows Google to identify the best apple pie recipe among the 16 million results. Without the links the only information Google would have is word frequency.

Links can take many forms and have adapted over time. Every time a user votes on content in a social network they add a connection between themselves and the content. This in turn links the consumer to the producer through the content. The more connections a network has the more valuable the information becomes. It is the relative and intentional connectedness of information that gives it value.

A social network can maximize the value extracted from a set of content by maximizing the quantity and quality of connections. Curating content is expensive and time consuming while being near impossible for computers to perform in the absence of links. Steem rewards users who are among the first to find and identify new content.

By incentivising curation the Steem network is able to use automated algorithms to extract the most valuable information from a massive amount of content.

## Solving the Cryptocurrency Onboarding Problem

It isn’t easy to get into cryptocurrency[^21]. Someone who discovers Bitcoin and wants to try it out quickly learns that they will need to sign up with an exchange and fund their account with a credit card or wire transfer. What would Facebook’s adoption rate have been like if you had to fork over money and a two forms of ID?

Steem solves this problem by giving everyone a way to get paid for doing simple, but valuable, tasks. This will help to widely distribute STEEM tokens. This is helpful because cryptocurrencies have a network effect (i.e. more users make it more useful; for an extreme example, consider that if Satoshi had kept 100% of Bitcoin for himself, Bitcoin would be worthless.)

## Solving the Cryptocurrency Liquidation Problem

A currency that is difficult to use or impossible to sell has little value. Someone who comes across $1.00 worth of Bitcoin will discover that it costs more than $1.00 to sell that Bitcoin. They have to create an account with an exchange, perform KYC validation, and pay fees. Small amounts of cryptocurrency are like small change that people are unwilling to bend over to pick up.

Merchants give users a way to quickly convert their cryptocurrency into tangible goods and services. Merchants need a currency pegged to their unit of account, normally dollars. Accepting a volatile currency introduces significant accounting overhead.

Merchants will accept any currency if it increases their sales. Having a large user base with a stable currency such as SBD lowers the barrier to entry for merchants. The presence of merchants improves the system by creating an off-ramp for users to exit the system without going to the trouble of using an exchange.

Another way that people can liquidate the small amounts of cryptocurrency they receive from participating on the Steem platform is through *tipping* others. This is like leaving the small change as a tip for your waiter. When enough people leave small tips it adds up to a meaningful amount. You and the waiter each gain a benefit from the tip.

## Censorship

Steem is a decentralized network that is operated by witnesses in jurisdictions around the world. All user actions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, and can be publicly verified. This means that there is no single entity that can censor content that is valued by STEEM holders.

Individual websites such as steemit.com may censor content on their particular site, but content published on the blockchain is inherently broadcast traffic and mirrors all around the world may continue to make it available.

Freedom of speech is the foundation of all other liberties and any infringement upon freedom of speech undermines the only peaceful means of reaching consensus: discussion. Without free discussion voters cannot be fully informed, and uninformed voters are a greater threat to society than losing the right to vote. Censorship is a means of stealing votes through limiting public discourse. Steem is committed to enabling free speech and building a free society.

## Solving Organic Discovery via Search Engine Optimization

Most cryptocurrencies generate little value for those who are not actively using the network. Steem, by contrast, generates content and encourages users to share it. This content gets indexed by search engines and ultimately will bring value to a large number of passive users. This search traffic creates organic advertising for the Steem network and grows the network effect.

## Shifting Toward Blockchain-based Attribution

The internet represents the easiest medium for distributing information in the world. With that said, it can be a frightening place for content creators who would like to own their content and have it shared with proper attribution. On current social media platforms, attribution is something that can be lost overnight - a posted video or image can be replicated and re-shared without consent or regard for the creator.

Under blockchain-based social media, a creator or author would always be able to point to a public record and timestamp showing proof of their content origination. In a circumstance where a creator would like to address those who have re-shared without permission or attribution, blockchain-based records provide public proof that the content was posted by a particular user at a particular time. In the future, blockchain-based attribution could come to be recognized by governments for its authenticity and could hold weight in court, which would give content creators greater powers to control their work.

While a timestamping service can be built on almost any blockchain, and several efforts exist to build this kind of service on the Bitcoin network, Steem has a useful advantage in this realm because content publishers are “first class citizens” -- the Steem blockchain is built from the ground up around the use case of content publication, which allows content creators to have the blockchain to validate their content at a certain point in time simply by writing their post using the same authoring tools used by other Steem users.

## Replacing Advertising with Blockchain-based Content Rewards

Under most content monetization models, content creators leverage advertising in one form or another. Many creators recognize how advertising may diminish their work’s value to the consumer, yet creators very often must seek returns on their time by monetizing. Advertising represents a double-edged sword: With ads, a creator can make money most easily. Without ads, monetization is difficult but the content is richer.

Creators posting to social media outlets that are connected to Steem may monetize merely by having their work recognized (or ”liked”) by the Steem community. Blockchain-based payouts are completely digital and have no middle-man. Therefore monetization by blockchain-based content rewards should be faster and much lower barrier to use than monetization by advertisements.

# Conclusion

Steem is an experiment designed to address challenges in the cryptocurrency and social media industries by combining the best aspects from both. Steem presents earning opportunities to content creators and internet readers in ways that have not existed within the social media industry. Within Steem, individuals earn real rewards online that are directly correlated to their contributions. Those rewards may have dollar value due to the market price discovery and liquidity of Steem, and the people who hold Steem may have more exclusive earning powers than those who do not.
